First opening the reading in “The Waste makers”, I was met with the quote “There are more passenger cars in the land than there are families.” To start out, this quote in particular had made me question everything I had come to know about the problem we face in our nation today. I had little to no idea that our desire for these products had gotten anywhere close to that point. Although the quote can be something that is obvious, it still shocked me nevertheless. 

<br><br>
The reading had been very informative, as I learned so much about the specifics of “auto-craving” consumer culture and marketing (something i've never really looked into). I believe the reading had great information about the roles and expectations of buyers due to companies always pushing out so many versatile products that people “need to buy”. It was so interesting to hear the 3 aspects that are manipulated in order to create more function and desire for their products. Changing and playing with aspects of quality, function, and desirability has been increasingly popular with companies, that ensures that consumers desire and use for the product. 
<br><br>

When I was going through the reading, I had started to reflect about the way I personally reacted to this “auto-craving” culture and how I rate among everybody else. The truth is, I have never thought about my need for these useless items until now. I feel as if I have been told the truth while everybody else has been told a lie, and that is concerning. As I am just learning now how badly my craving affects the environment, the planet I love, and the poor in other countries, many people won't come to these conclusions. The sad truth is, if nobody is informed about the dangers of consumerism and how badly it is killing the planet, it will never cease to stop.

This has been one of the most interesting readings for me, as I find it very interesting to read about the 20th century, and more if it deals with cultural attitudes about the environment and how consumption has been ingrained in the American public for generations. I found it fascinating to read how the American government, in collaboration with various industries promoted a culture of buying. “Buy, buy, buy; it’s your patriotic duty.” 

<br><br>

This was one of the many quotes that shocked me the most from reading these first few chapters. This also brought to mind the notion that the United States has incorporated this ideology of capitalism into the definition of the nation, and nationalism. The chapter on “Growthmanship” highlights this idea of rapid growth for the nation to continue upholding political and economic hegemony. It mentions that the nation's main challenge at the time was to “make sure the citizenry will be induced to enjoy more and more of the good things in life”. So, after reading this chapter it makes a lot of sense how our society has reached a point where we see most things we buy as disposable. This chapter concludes by mentioning that the American economy heavily depends on producing consumers and keeping them in a voracious, wasteful cycle, which will in turn keep the economy growthing. 

<br><br>

Another chapter I found very interesting was ch 5 on “Progress Through the Throwaway Spirit”. I got the chills reading the mini quote from Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World because it accurately represents the world we are living in today. The very dangers that Huxley warns us about  in his book are very visible in today’s society. Children are being turned into mini consumers from a very young age. We live in an age of commercialization and advertisements that directly target children from a very young age. It’s frustrating reading about how easily the public, including myself, have been targeted and fooled into buying unnecessary items. There are so many items in my life I have purchased that were honestly a waste of money because they ended up only being used once or just stored in some random drawer. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that has a junk drawer at home where I place all the random items that I can't seem to find a place or use for, and I think this is characteristic of American homes, because for so long we have been encouraged to buy without hesitation. I have definitely been trying to make wiser choices when I buy items, making sure they are things I will use often, and that will last me a long time.

The reading “The Waste Maker” was very informative and I would consider it eye-opening. In this reading, we are able to learn the tactics that the companies use to make people buy their objects.in chapter 4 they discuss the concept of color "matching" in order to make sales was used in promoting home accessories and other objects. I was very interested since it’s true and we are not satisfied with owning one object in one color. I personally have at least 3 shoes that are the same style, yet the different colors and I could say the same about shirts and jeans. We feel the need to have them so we can match them with other outfits or the theme, I found it crazy that companies try to sell more clothing by using ideas such as one suit for swimming, one for sunning, and one for"psychology. When I read that I was like, why can’t it just be one that does all, and there is but these companies make it seem like you need to own 3 or more pairs.

<br><br>

A line that caught my attention was “each fabricated item was cherished, perhaps because it was hard to come by ''. This quote is sad but true, we don't know where certain objects come from so we don't know what was the process behind the making. This goes back to the film, the True cost since we are not suffering the consequences such as the people in India, or Bangladesh who are making the products at a cheap price for the US. Another thing that caught my interest was the 3 types of Obsolescences, which were function, quality, and desirability. As I read that I was like wow we use all of these and especially desirability since there are always newer versions coming out for electronics such as laptops and cars. For example, I want to get a new laptop since I feel like mine is so old, yet I barely got it in 2017. & I feel like others think the same, or another example would be people who buy cars and want the newest one year after year, just cause it has a small new feature. We are made to buy products and we desire the need to have the newest thing so we aren’t out of trend.



</p><hr>


<p>

When I heard that cars do the same thing as the fashion industry, it never occurred to me that it was a similar concept. Things like phones, computers, cars, and clothes are always changing and is encouraged for people the get the new best thing. Even now I hold cheap phones tat I use for years because i'm not a heavy phone user, however I do often get teased about it although it doesn't mean much to me I can see certain people feeling obligated to get a new version. It's become to norm that phone companies come out with a new device every year or have new computers with barely any changes on them to be reinvented and sold as a new item. This is environmentally disastrous as out planet cannot deal with this level of consumerism. All of our old stuff is considered outdated but work perfectly fine and are thrown away as if they are unusable. and even so not recycled as many parts are sent straight to a landfill. 
<br><br>


Unfortunately this type of consumerism wont be easy to get rid of as we are used to a lifestyle full of stuff. We can go online or to the store and literally buy anything we could possibly need. We are so spoiled as a people that any attempt to slow this down will be met with criticism and odds are anyone in power will be kicked out of office. It would be impossible to prevent this any further unless we had a strict dictator.

<p>
Although I already knew a lot of the information presented in “The Waste Makers,” I was appalled by the extensive nature of consumerism.  From the impact on the environment to each individual’s overall contentment with life, the mass culture of consumerism is something I believe needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.  The notion of buying something to use once and never again drives me crazy; not only is this practice terrible for the environment, it does not lead to long term peace and happiness like many people believe it does.  However, it doesn't surprise me that companies enjoy profiting off the suffering of people and the environment; consumerism is just a money-making scheme, anyways.
<br><br>


This might sound incredibly pessimistic, but I do not think people will voluntarily transition to a simpler, less consumer based existence on their own.  Our society has fooled the majority of people into thinking that happiness comes hand in hand with the newest technological device, fashion trend, or household appliance.  Fancier cars, homes, and electronics have become a measure of success and personal freedom.  However, this is merely a facade perpetrated by the mass consumerist society we live in.  In order to mitigate the impact consumerism has on the environment, there must be a change in the way we educate the population on the necessity of goods.  There needs to be a fundamental shift in perspective where the natural earth means more than the newest iphone and community is more important than owning a mansion.  I hope that the culture transitions to a sustainable, healthy way of living; however, I am not sure if this mass change in worldview can happen in the time it needs to.

The Waste Makers does an amazing job touching on each of the aspects of the evolution from Great Depression consumer culture into modern American consumer culture. Some of the facts that these chapters provided led me to think, "if only he knew how bad it would get". As a reader in the age of the trillion dollar company, I laughed at the mention of the pursuit of the trillion dollar U.S economy. Planned obsolescence is truly a culmination of each of the strategies that both companies and advertising agencies have employed in order to get Americans to reach that goal of never ending growth. While reading, I instantly thought of the iPhone. A new model each year, promising to be more revolutionary than any model before it. Apple does a fantastic job at performing every level of planned obsolescence.
<br><br>
Function: With the new phone we get the new processing chip. You can now download entire movies at light speed on the moon. Also another camera. Hell yeah. I want to see every single pore on my face when I take a selfie. We applaud the engineers for their hard work.
<br><br>
Quality: I download a new software update that promises it'll cure world hunger but actually now when I hit the home button it calls the police. This will not do. Let me go get the new model! If you resist the call of the new IOS, you will be cursed with reminders that it is available for download every 15 minutes, but your phone will last longer.
<br><br>
Desirability: Ah yes. I sit beside my friend who can now take pictures of atoms with the newest model and I hear the taunt. "Oh my god you still have the 8? Look at this. Watch what mine can do". The new model every year eventually becomes social currency. Airpods recently became an enormous meme in which those who have wires on their earbuds were seen as "broke". The result? Apple's showed record revenue this year.

<br><br>

Who cares if it smells like broke in here? Get over it. Wires are fine.

It is interesting how some people think it's more important to have the latest iPhone, and yet they struggle with food insecurity. In "The Waste Makers", Packard addresses this concept in mentioning that "the television set may be substituting for adequate food in the family budget.” 
<br><br>
This shows how powerful marketing and consumerism are in convincing us that we need things that we really are probably better off without. 
<br><br>
Personally, I care about not buying into consumerism as much by specifically not purchasing anything new. This past summer, I found myself giving into buying a pair of shorts from H&M for $3 because my friends wanted to match. I didn't want to be excluded or shamed, so I didn't speak up for my own values. Thus, I agree that the social currency concept really comes into play here.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with you that it is ridiculous how much money companies are able to make due to planned obsolescence. There was a conspiracy theory going around a while back about how every time a new iphone comes out, the older models’ batteries would suddenly stop working as efficiently. There may be more truth to this than we realize. It is so sad to me that the goal of companies is to rip people off and make a ton of money doing it, when in reality they should be providing a product that is meant to last. The newer versions of the phones have glass backings instead of whatever it was previously. Why did they change this you ask? My guess is to make even more money off of customers because now, not only your screen can crack but the back of it can too! The back of my phone is cracked right now and rather than rush to go fix it I just slapped a case on it because I refuse to spend $100 on a piece of glass. Not only with iphones, but every product you can imagine, a majority of companies are choosing quantity over quality to turn a profit and are coming out with newer and newer versions of items so the ones we have become out of style. I am learning to instead mend things that become broken, buy higher quality items from trusted sustainable brands, and resist the pressures of society telling me that if I don’t have the most or the newest than my worth is less. My worth comes from Jesus baby, not material items and certainly not society!

This is way too real, the way you described Apple’s products. I have often wondered why these smartphones update so fast, why can’t they just be like consoles which update every five years or so. But now, learning about this planned obsolescence, I can fully understand how companies promote consumerism as well as the rapid discard of commodities. This got me wondering if large technological companies also hide a lot of its novel inventions from the public just to release them year by year to gain more profit. 
<br><br>
It is truly scary and inhumane about this idea of planned obsolescence, but it is also the nature of capitalism in which the elites would need to maximize profit at the sake of everything else.



<br><hr>
You bring up a really good observation about Apple. I too, instantly thought of Apple when they discussed planned obsolescence. It’s truly sad how some of the biggest, most celebrated products and businesses are successful based on the manipulation of consumers to continuously buy their “newer” products. It’s sad that this culture isn’t just perpetuated by the businesses themselves, but by us consumers too. We feed into this culture because somehow having the newest product makes us feel better about ourselves and superior to others. 
<br><br>

Apple most definitely uses planned obsolescence but it made me wonder, what can we do? Sure, we can stop caving into the new model every time it comes out and only buy a new phone and our current one is down to its last bone. But ultimately, we’re still buying products that won’t last as long as they should. Should we not buy Apple products at all anymore? Or not buy smartphones? Would that even be possible in this digital age?




<br><hr>

I also immediately thought of Apple while reading "The Waste Makers." Not so much in the sense that you mentioned, however. Every year Apple releases a new phone with a new chip or camera or whatever. But every year, this phone includes very few of the features that consumers actually want. For example, we just got dark mode last year yet we've been asking for it for the last few years. Part of me believes that Apple does this purposely, just to keep their customers loyal. Rather than putting everything into one model and not having any new ideas for the next, they slowly give us what we want in bits and pieces. Apple also connects all of your devices so that you have no choice but to buy their products. A year ago, people had their iPhone, Mac, and iPad connected via iCloud, so everything on one devices is shared among the other two. Want a new, non-Apple phone? Now you have to find a way to transfer all your data and have to manually sync it because iCloud isn't available for Samsung phones. In addition, Apple recently released a credit card that you have to use your iPhone to pay. Now, if you want another phone, you have to go through the process of cancelling a credit card. Don't get me wrong, I love Apple and I'm certainly a sucker for their newest phone, but things like that definitely make me think about all the ways companies suck you into their brand.



<br><hr>

I agree, big companies like Apple and Samsung use obsolescence to make lots of profit each year. They are constantly developing items that look more aesthetic to the eye, for example phones which they are making thinner and adding glass which make the item look nicer but all that more fragile. They made them like that for a reason not so they are lighter to carry but because it’s more likely that if it falls it will break and you will either have to pay an expensive fee to get it fixed or buy a new one. Also I used to have a samsung tv that worked perfectly at the beginning,but a few years later the tv started getting slow and apps such as youtube or netflix were no longer supported on the tv. So eventually we had to get new tvs and having read the fact that companies build products knowing they won’t last long, makes a lot of sense now. I think it is really unfair to the consumers that companies advertise products as high quality and lasting even though that is not the case. I think as consumers we need to be made more aware of this and resist the temptation of always trying to have the newest products when ones we have are perfectly fine and not get up with what advertisements or social media says.

I related to the points you made in your comment. The first thing I thought of while reading this was Apple. They are highly focused on obsolescence, and I would go as far as to say that obsolescence is the center of their business model. Not only do they release a new iPhone with slightly new features and upgraded hardware and software, it seems their technology is hard-wired to break quickly and replaced quickly. 
<br><br>
While I had owned an iPhone, the charger and earpods would inevitably break near either end. The wires would be exposed outside the cheap casing. There was no way the cords would survive for a notable amount of time, even with good practices.
<br><br>
In addition, they have been criticized multiple times for slowing speeds in an attempt save battery life. They did not even inform the user or give an option to opt out. I personally believe this seems at least a little bit sketchy and is a plan to sell the user a new, expensive iPhone. 
<br><br>
Although it is viable to stay with an older model of the iPhone, Apple and society makes it difficult to do so. There are advertisements and memes showcasing the delights of having a new phone. This idea that new technology is a necessity has been forced upon the consumer. This has created a culture of throwing away usable objects to get new versions, creating waste and wasting money.



<br><hr>
I agree with you completely. Apple has done a great job of "performing every level of planned obsolescence" and AirPods are their latest take. And it's not even about looking broke or like you have money, but they've made it so having the latest phone or wearing AirPods makes you trendy. I love my wired earphones, but the other day I was listening to music on my computer and my friend asked me "why my AirPods had wires?" And of course, she immediately realized the folly of what she said after asking and we all laughed. And not at her specifically, but just knowing that she's had AirPods for so long that seeing wires was probably almost unfamiliar to her. It's kinda sad how much we've bought into these large companies and their marketing strategies. But it's even worse that we've made it so having the latest product characterizes the kind of person you are. Like more specifically, I've heard people diss android users, and even though it is for comedic value, it still says a lot about the culture we're fostering.

I find a line from “The Waste Makers” very interesting, “spokesmen for industry like to speculate about tomorrow even more than the rest of us.” It’s pretty astonishing to know that companies marketing in certain ways so that their productions don’t stock up or get wasted, but as a result of the marketing techniques, the estimated consumption level will rise for about 50 percent in the next decades. For a producer, whose products many families already own, it is hard to further promote them with similar products that have no significant improvements. In fact, many producers improve daily appliances to make them prettier, more aesthetically pleasing.
<br><br>
The point is not that technologies can’t be further improved, it is that companies are more willing to improve or fix small details of their products. I think electronic devices would explain this pretty well: as soon as they reach a point where the products are relatively advanced and well-designed, they move on to more detailed things about their product: the color, the button, or the shape of the edge of the screen. It seems like all companies want to earn a higher place in their competitions with other companies by having larger inventories, higher production, and larger shelves.

Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” introduced me to how deep and dark America’s problem with consumption is. This issue of intensely and meticulously planned advertisements that are intended to convince consumers that they don’t just want things, they need things is incredibly problematic. As Packard says, America, and corporations in particular, have created a “brand new breed of super customers” that simply cannot ever get enough. As consumers we have again and again given in to the sneaky techniques of advertising and have tried to justify our actions along the way. We might claim to be “helping the economy” or simply just “keeping up with trends” but what we are truly doing is killing the planet that provides us a home. We cannot keep making excuses for our reckless consumption. 
<br><br>


One of the most concerning chapters was “There’s Always Room for More” because it revealed just how easily people can be swayed by the persuasive techniques of advertisement. People constantly buy multiples of products for seemingly meaningless reasons such as for color coordination in different rooms. I found it especially shocking to find out that people even own more than one home, because this seems to be phasing out at least somewhat from when this book was written. Although I have heard of the concept of having “a lake house” or some sort of second home I have never been able to fathom what it would be like to want more than one house. Especially today, more and more people are struggling to even pay for a tiny apartment so it is hard to see incredibly wealthy people consuming without a care even when it comes to housing. Although less surprising, it is still unfortunate to consider that many families own several cars. My family is guilty of this as both of my parents own a car, and I know many others that are in the same situation of falling into the social norm of thinking we all need our own personal mode of transportation. It is so important that going forward everyone starts to be more mindful about our large purchases such as with housing and transportation because these large purchases have large consequences. 
<br><br>


This previous point about the detriment of large purchases is not to undermine the severe consequences of all the little purchases we make as well. This point fits in well with the fifth chapter, “Progress Through the Throwaway Spirit,” which considers just how frequently we produce little amounts of waste that add up. It is so sad to think about just how many companies design packaging to prevent the complete usage of a product to increase their sales. We are constantly surrounded by “disposable” products and it is often just in our nature to purchase throwaway items without any consideration just because of their convenience. I try to make the most of my purchases such as with a reusable water bottle or by repurposing plastic containers intended for single use, but I still do break this progress somewhat often, especially when it comes to food and drink. 

<br><br>

This reading also introduced me to the idea of planned obsolescence. Although it is an incredibly common practice I was unaware that the purposeful sabotage of a product had an official name. Planned obsolescence is unfortunately super common, especially when it comes to fast fashion and technology. It is so ingrained in our culture that we should have the latest and greatest of everything and that what we have will become meaningless once something better is introduced. More and more increasingly seasons of fashion are becoming shorter and Iphones are being released annually, prompting people to have items for far less time than they are actually useful for. It is far past due that we stop consuming out of our selfish wants and do our best to consume what we practically need. No one is perfect but we need to take a step in the right direction and influence our overall consumer culture to make a serious shift.

When I was in an art class in my high school, I saw how wasteful my classmates were: they took a ton of acrylic paints at the beginning of the class, then dumped most of them into the sink at the end while a large portion of these paints looked very new. This week’s reading confirmed my idea: people are making a lot of waste in our daily life. What’s more, a huge portion of our daily waste is unconscious. Consumerism now takes our idea of purchasing items in our daily life. For instance, I buy six to seven pieces of clothes every month on average but obviously, I’m not buying clothes because I have nothing to wear; I buy because my desire for shopping got promoted by things like Instagram posts or other advertisements. It’s interesting that “Waste Makers” stated that the fashion companies keep making similar products for seasons to make people feel that the old products are outdated. The idea of “planned obsolescence” is very new to me. I can come up with many examples but I didn’t realize this is one of the strategies that those companies are utilizing to enlarge their benefits. I'm very reluctant to admit this, but this strategy really worked.

I was genuinely surprised by Vance Packard's perspective in his book, "The Waster Makers".  Knowing that it was written in the 60's, I genuinely expected a worthless, outdated view in regard to our current political climate and issues. However, to be completely honest, I think many of the topics are still relevant to the modern day, showcasing that this is not a recent issue, but one that has spanned multiple generations. I don't even think climate change is the primary concern. Instead, it is a concern of personal well-being and how consumers are heavily affected by the unhealthy corporate mentality. The abhorrent effect on the climate is just one of the many potential, resulting side effects. 
<br><br>
 Although this problem is quite universal, I think the wasteful culture of America is particularly  problematic. Over the summer, I went to Japan for the first time and was genuinely astonished by how well citizens treat the environment. Just walking down a suburban neighborhood near Tokyo, I noticed a disturbing lack of litter and half-chewed gum stains on the ground. While staying at my airbnb, there was noticeably less plastic and significantly more reused containers. In the fifth chapter, Packard states "Americans like to think that in the earlier days, if not today, frugality was the rule." While this was true for a newly established America, our over abundance of materials and produce have caused us to become wasteful with little care for how we are affecting ourselves, the environment, etc. As a result, we proceed to buy more things, only encouraging companies to produce more waste, an endless cycle that perpetuates an extremely unhealthy culture. 
<br><br>
I also find it extremely disturbing how capable the industry is able to manipulate the common man's desires. The idea that they have the ability to market things or concepts that are completely unnecessary for our well-being is astonishing. (Seriously, how do you convince someone that they need multiple houses?!). Everything they produce is just a new method of them to gain more money or exposure. Even products as trivial as deodorant were separated by gender for the sole purpose of selling more total units. Of course, this problem has only become increasingly worse in  the modern era looking at the  excessive amount of needless labels and accessories that are sold on a daily basis.

In today’s consumer culture, I have always lived my life waiting for next season’s new fashion line or a big company’s new technology. To me this type of life was second nature. However, The Waste Makers showed me the shocking reality that I have been accustomed to since I first began partaking in consumerism, which was apparently at a much younger age than I originally thought.
 <br><br>

Reading this article, I was actually really disheartened because I was unaware how businesses were intentionally cheapening the production of my goods so that I would be forced to buy more from them in the future. I understand from an economic standpoint that their planned obsolescence works in their favor by increasing the amount of money they make. The hard thing for me to understand, though, is how they are able to turn a blind eye to all the wrong they cause. Terrible factory working conditions, increased air pollution, and preying on the unhappiness of their consumers, all of these problems are very visible, yet not acknowledged at all. The article did very well to compile all the mistakes of big companies, now if only they could also change public mindset.

The Waste Makers really expanded my horizon on how this world works….Now I know why Costco is always selling everything in bulk; I know why there is new series or collections annually; I know why there is a day called Black Friday. This is all about capitalism-what the companies want is only the money. They are making us feel like we are saving by making us spending. This is horrible as the Truman Show. I feel like we are being manipulated by the advertisements around us which are indirectly affecting our choice of consumption, our values and views for the world. 
 <br><br>
Prof. Hiltner is right, climate change is a technological issue indeed, but it is also an issue regarding to social sciences. Or, we could say, it can be solved through social aspect. How? The answer is quite clear. We should reduce carbon emission by realizing what we want is not more and new. We need true happiness in our lives as short as they are. So what is true happiness to you? Maybe it’s a healthy body, a quiet morning and a cup of coffee. This is the best way to balance between reducing carbon emission and living a life that you will remember. Why haven’t been told anything like this before? Why didn’t the government post promotion like this via media? Well, I think it, again, has something to do with political issue which is too complicated for me to explain. And what can we do about this? Vote. Vote for participants who you think will fulfill the need for our generation and will take the need of next generation under consideration. And please let more of your friends know about this.

I’ve always believed in the saying, “Nature vs. Nurture”, meaning people's beliefs, choices, and behaviors are greatly influenced by either the DNA instructions in their body at birth or the people/society/culture that surrounds them; and I believe in the latter. It's interesting to look at the world through different lenses, it gives you the ability to understand not only why they made a choice, but what influenced them to make it. Now this influence can come from anywhere, and with the globalization of the world through trade, politics, media, etc, it is easier than ever to find influence when developing your own “opinion”. I honestly believe that yes the climate change may have been avoidable, but in truth, I believe that it is inevitable to happen, there is only the idea of how long can you delay the inevitable. This is where I switch to a much more positive mood as I do believe that we can implement changes in our society to GREATLY reduce how fast we are moving to what anyone considers final results of the climate crisis.

I found “The Waste Makers” to be very entertaining and interesting to read. The chapters we read focused on the ultra-consumerist lifestyle Americans led in the 1950s and 1960s (and still do today). The reading also gave insights into behind-the-scenes details of advertising companies and the production and sales methods of various items. Many parts of the reading - like the chapter describing how “throw away” disposable products were popular, and the chapter detailing how the American public was convinced to consume as much as possible - made me cringe with how environmentally terrible it sounded. It’s so unfortunate how the American people have been purposefully taught by advertising and profit-seeking companies that buying excess material items will lead to happiness, and that there was a time when people bought into this false narrative without any regard to the environmental consequences. I also found it frustrating to learn more about the artificial lifespans for products in order for the customer to have to buy more. Overall, I enjoyed reading this part of the book because it was a snapshot in time to an earlier era of American history, culture and consumerism, which I find fascinating.

When reading this, I was honestly both surprised and impressed at the different ways companies make people believe they have to purchase new products every single week. More specifically, by producing something that will fall apart soon after wearing or using, the companies just get more and more money from people that are upgrading or fixing their previous purchases. I can honestly say this has worked really well. For example, Apple can easily produce an indestructible iPhone that probably wouldn't ever need a case. Instead, they make the phones relatively easy to crack, so consumers go out and buy a case that Apple also makes money off of. While the consumer believes their phone will last a while since they have  a protective case, Apple purposefully slows down previous iPhones so people have to buy a newer model, along with the case. The cycle continues endlessly, while old phones are thrown out very quickly, and Apple makes billions from it. 
 <br><br>

Also, with clothing, companies push out new models and make consumers believe they have to buy all the new stuff so they can make more and more money every year. I've generally stopped trying to buy a lot of clothes and become happier with the clothes I like, even though I'm certainly not perfect with this. For some, weekly and monthly clothing sprees are necessary, and their closets are filled with clothes they wore once or twice, creating more stuff and waste in the world, but more money for the producers, which is all they really care about.

After reading The Waste Makers and subsequently watching Ken’s video introducing it, I agree with the connection he made to the fact that consumerism is a culture that makes people increasingly discontented. This is something that stood out to me because it reminded me of Walden, in which Thoreau emphasizes how things and stuff drag us down. When the economy requires consumers to demand more with each buy, it’s impossible to achieve happiness. And people constantly want more because they’re taught from birth that everything is replaceable. No wonder people waste so much—it’s ingrained as part of our culture. 
 <br><br>

Since the 1950s, America’s abundance makes Say’s Law less relevant. Because America’s productive capacity is now too high for its demand, companies have to ensure consumers’ wastefulness. And it shocked me how many things are the product of companies trying to make people consume more. Like the double wedding rings. We need to move our economy away from consumerism and into sustainability. If less demand for products puts people out of jobs, people can start their career paths on something environmental instead, which the future needs.

In the book “The Waste Makers” the background of American Consumerism culture, the reasons for this, as well as the strategies which the producers utilized to attract the purchasing of consumers were introduced in detail. During the 1950s, because of the expansion of manufacturing facilities and the “ever-growing efficiency” of American’s productive force, the inventories of all the goods were increased, which led to the greater consumptions of the people at that time. As a result, “Consumerism” was emerged.
 <br><br>
The writer Vance Packard, born at the period of American Great Depression, who used to consume things completely until it cannot work strongly disagree the phenomena which people throw away the old-fashion things, therefore strongly criticized the Consumerism, and the companies which employed several strategies to attract purchasing of people by wrote the book “The Waste Makers.” In the book, he mentions several strategies. For example, they encourage consumers to purchase by saying that there was always space for new stuff, “throwaway spirit” should be admired, and using the “planned obsolescence.” 
 <br><br>
For the “planned obsolescence,” it was a strategy that artificially influences either the shape of their products or the attitude of buying consumers had to encourage the spirit of throwaway. It can be divided into three types: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality and the obsolescence of desirability. Although the obsolescence of function, which is the innovation of the productions, can be considered as an improvement of technology that benefits the consumers, the obsolescence of quality and desirability are the results of producers’ greedy undisputedly. To make more profits, companies made stuffs that have certain lifespans and attracting the purchase by simply switch the style of fashion. More than that, like Ken mentions in his lecture that in the market of cigarettes in the early 20th century, there were some companies such as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco company disregarded the warning of health, creating cartoon character to attract innocent children to become their consumers just for making more profits. This really shocked and annoyed me a lot.

It is true that with growing economy and technology, the production factories are making more products over time and the ideas of mass production and consumption are instilled in people’s minds.
  <br><br>
 I do agree with you saying that the scariest thing is the evil idea behind the mass production. People nowadays are not buying things because they need it, but simply because the ads, market the trends making them do so. Ask yourself how much things you bought are actually not necessary and how often you just throw away things. And what’s more important? In order to keep the get all their products sold, they intentionally make people think they should keep buying new things and throw away the old one.
   <br><br>
 Human are being kind of selfish because people only think about how to make profits and how to buy things to fulfill desires but never think of the impacts that will be put on our planet. When consumption is needed, what we can do to minimize the bad impacts caused to our environment when producing and disposing goods is the key thing to be considered and solved.

I too was interested in the background of the American Consumer culture. When Vance Packard became discussing how we hit a point where people had so many things that marketing had to turn into how to get people to be more wasteful and more compulsive in their consumerism. Even the term 'treat yo self' that is used today feeds into this compulsive wasteful mindset of you deserve more and a better version. It turned the whole industry into focusing on newer shinier gadgets in newer models. It added this embarrassment and shame onto having an older model even if it worked just fine. When Packard discussed how lawns are getting smaller yet lawn mowers are becoming more complex and powered, that really stuck with me. Literally, the urge to be lazier and have shiny powered things are controlling consumerism without any regard for the environment. 
 <br><br>

I think the market on mufflers further exemplified this talking about how women were the focus of the marketing. Car mufflers were painted gold, psychologist trained workers on how to talk to women and how to draw them in. It is pretty creepy and manipulative. All of it is manipulative and I like that the fact that Packard addressed that all of this is happening without the well being of the country being considered. It is so frustrating and annoying.

Possibly my most striking realization from reading The Waist Makers was that my understanding of why the house where I grew up had closets full of unused items and unworn clothing. I had always assumed that the reason why there was simply so much stuff in my house was because that was the way things were supposed to be--if clothing tore or started to fade you would put it in a box in the basement, not throw it out and certainly not attempt to have it repaired. When a new appliance came out it was natural to simply throw the older one away without regard to the fact that it was still working. A naturally disgusting feeling stemming from my reading is that the reason why my family did these things and why I now do these things is because some man in a Mad Men esq building in the fifties and sixties decided that people needed to own more in order to increase production. People were convinced to waste their money and did so merrily for social clout or their own lack of regard to the power of consumer goods. As this idea developed into the theme of planned obsolescence, its effect on my life is now clear. When buying clothing or goods my mind always rests on how good it looks or how good it works, not if it will last long or be durable. What is even more strange is thinking about how companies today can revert from this accepted principle to sell even more goods, as outdoor companies like Patigonia and REI are using “durability” as the standard for their goods. I just feel gross thinking about how something about my life is just so accepted and normalized, it feels like a betrayal of my trust and an influence that corporations have on my life that I am not truly comfortable with.

When learning more about the consumerism society that once was, I was surprised to learn that it started so long ago. The evil behind the production that Ken talks about using examples like cigarettes and children outweighs any type of advertising strategy in out society today. As for whose fault it is that we have a consumerism society, I believe that both sides are to blame. Before the reading I believed this to be true but my belief was backed up with the new information that I learned. It is a cycle of people wanting things, industries making them, and then people getting hooked. Though we may not need new shoes or new clothes for example, when our favorite brand has a new drop, we feel inclined to buy it. So, the consumerism culture really can't be blamed on a single person or single company, rather it should be a collective blame.



<br><Hr>
I definitely agree with you, the book highlights the never-satisfied 'consumerism' that our society circulates with. I find it alarming that they encourage consumers to keep buying new stuff all for the sake of trend, hence the term, 'planned obsolescence'.  Sure, our innovative and creative thinking are being expressed in developing and crafting things that are 'new to trend' and thus, seen by the media and society as humanity's advancement. With that being said, I am confused to whether we as a society are advancing or are we slowly digging our own grave? Just like you, I am shocked and annoyed that companies are making new products and new trends just to lure consumers, all for the sake of profit. Companies will do anything from not abiding by their own code of conducts, disregarding the warning of health, and like you said, even attracting innocent children as labor force or consumer target to make profitable gains.



<br><Hr>
I agree with you, and I believe that “planned obsolescence” is the key point that is being discussed in Chapter 2-7 in the book “The Waste Maker” by Vance Packard. Before reading this article, I never knew that factories or producers may intentionally shorten the lifespan of a product, which in turn trigger more consumers to purchase their commodities, and finally, to maximize their profit. Sometimes being environmental friendly is kind of paradox to nation’s economy growth. If people buying less stuff, factories and exports will decrease, which leads to an decrease in GDP. Therefore, to some extend, it’s reasonable for politicians to make a decision between protecting environment and promote country’s economic growth. I also found something more interesting about the modern style of consumption. People nowadays are more incline to dispose their stuff, rather than repair or recycle them, and in my opinion, I believe that this is not only consumer’s false concept of consumption, but also the massive production of factories increase the rate of discard.

With today's economy, consumerism plays a major role in this consuming culture. The international trade and convenient air or ground freighting lowers the cost and improves the time efficiency of the producers and the customers. People can just easily purchase an item with their cell phones with a three-day or even same-day shipping.
 <br><br>


I agree with you that producers in order to boost their sales which they have decreased the lifespan for the product. I have mentioned about cellphone above and I think the cellphone is a really good example. Before the encounter of cellphones, an old generation keyboard phone can be used for years without manually damaging it. But the cellphones are not like that. When mentions about the cellphone, APPLE is a classical example of the cellphone producer. Basically 1 to 2 years that APPLE will come out the next generation iPhone. And for most of the people that a new iPhone can be used for 2 to 3 years. The iPhone's operating speed will get slower and slower; and the more frequent that people need to charge their phones because in late-stage the iPhone's battery can not make it through a day. The "decreased life-span" is a vivid description of today's products' quality.

 <br><br>

To be honest, if a product lasts, most people do not want to change their products. But the current quality of products and the price of products is getting higher and higher. APPLE nearly doubled the price of the iPhone now, the newest generation iPhone 11 is about 1000 dollars. Consumerism will keep blooming if there is no strict rules of product regulations. And according to the book that the companies have many ways to attract or even "force" people to buy their products.

It still shocks me that our consumerism culture originated during and right after the second world war. Reading "The Waste Makers" was very frustrating because our environment would be so much better if it hadn't been for certain industries pushing this new consumerist culture onto the American people. While I agree that the strategy of attracting innocent, often underage people to detrimental products is a shameful practice, I don't necessarily see how it relates to planned obsolescence. Rather, it seems to me that the strategy of attracting innocent, unknowing customers can perpetuate planned obsolescence. The idea of products continually breaking and needing to be replaced is more easily ingrained in a more pliable youth. Essentially, by the time the 50s were over and a new generation had grown, the idea of planned obsolescence would be so anticipated that Consumer Culture could only grow.

When reading “The Waste Makers”, I was most stricken by a line in chapter 7.  As Allied Stores Corporation’s speaker B. Earl Puckett was explaining the idea behind accelerating obsolescence, “ It is our job to make women unhappy with what they have .... We must make them so unhappy that their husbands can find no happiness or peace in their excessive savings” (pg 72).  Though this was recorded in 1950 when women were not respected as independent the way they are today, I still was shocked at the generalization. Not only did the statement disrespect women by implying they are merely parasites for their husbands, it also sheds light upon the reins that corporations guide consumers by. More and more it becomes apparent that waste is not just the public’s fault, but it stems from the top, a neverending snowball that gains traction as time goes on.  I myself have felt the effects of this, as I am sure we all have—the idea that we need more to feel better, to get the most relevant products to stay on par with the rest of society, to fit in.  Humans are lonely creatures and yearn for a community to take part in the same caliber that corporations are greedy in terms of money.  And because of this, it is easy to take advantage exponentially without regard to the environment in any way, shape, or form.  I find this control leaks into my life even while passing billboard after billboard on my way home for the weekend, each one advertising something “new”, “better”, and “necessary”—when in reality it is anything but.  A huge concept of product desirability is how temporary it is, as the ability to replace it is what keeps the cycle going.  Not only is this fueling the filling of landfill after landfill, it is fueling the death of our earth as we know it.  Hopefully we can find ways to avoid giving in to the urge to have more and instead pursue happiness in what we are blessed to have already.

I really like this week's reading due to how straightforward and insightful it was. One thing that I notice was that it keeps jumping at me throughout the reading that all of it sounds like some dystopian fiction; everyday we mindlessly consume and continue straying further and further away from our values.
 <br><br>

It was really eye opening to look at the different tactics corporations use to make our daily products obsolete. There are discussions and deals made behind closed doors that we as consumers don't know about. It was interesting that there are scientists who really feels guilty about the role they play in the process, but comply anyway because this is how the economy works now and there must be "new ethics!"
 <br><br>

"Buy, buy, buy. It's your patriotic duty!" "If you're a good American, you buy a new radio." It's crazy to me that consumerism is so ingrained in American culture and the identity of the individual that I can imagine how easy it is to just trust the process and follow the system, and how confusing it might be for Americans who doesn't support consumerism and whether or not it affects their sense of belonging.
 <br><br>

At the end of chapter 7, there's a quote that says "Psychological obsolescence is a symptom related to the prevalence of boredom, lack of self expression, lack of free and truly friendly communications with friends and neighbors" and I personally find this to be true as I have had moments when I feel stagnant, and like I'm not experiencing a lot of growth is the academic, creative and social aspects of my life, I would scroll mindlessly on online shopping website and it would give me like this feeling of novelty, like I'm making progress, but then the feeling ends and the cycle starts all over again.
 <br><br>

As damaging and pointless planned obsolescence is, I can't help but find the argument in support of it compelling: the economy depends on it and a big part of the population will be out of jobs otherwise. I'm definitely interested in finding out if there're any solutions that address this issue.

"The Waste Maker" is an extremely interesting book because it looks at the American consumerist culture with almost an outside eye. We often see critiques from Americans who grew up in this world, but rarely from those who grew up before it. "The Waste Maker" touched a lot upon planned obsolesce in the home, which is a decently large problem today. For example, I see so many people buy a new phone just because their current one is a couple years old. I find I really need to step back and examine my life and make sure I'm not buying new things just because they're pretty and new. I know I am inclined to, old designs make me worry they'll be unsafe or not good enough, when they're really still fine. (80's mixer that's literally yellowed with age that I've been eyeing to replace for a while: You can stay... For now.)
 <br><br>
I'm intrigued by the idea of two everything in the ideal home. I don't think I've ever seen a home with two washers (heck, that's how many we have for my entire dorm) and a home with two fridges is fairly rare. Those are such large, expensive purchases for very little extra value. I'm glad that it's not the norm (nor the goal).
 <br><br>

I'm sincerely depressed that we were so close to having a generation free of nicotine addiction, but of course, the nicotine industry readdicted kids with a cool new upgrade (and no, not the addition of a camel mascot): the Juul. Which is one hundred percent marketed towards the youth. Bright colors, sleek designs, it's like a piece of tech. (I know I sound like a D.A.R.E. campaign, but please don't Juul guys, be smarter than that.)

Before reading this book, I thought that consumerism is a modern concept, but I was wrong. Consumerism has been so popular in the United States, even in 1960s. The over-consumption after World War II has boosted the production of industry, which created millions of waste. What Vance Packard emphasizes in his book is that the majority of goods people bought during that period was not necessary, and something redundant. It is ironic that people in modern society have the situation as people in the past 60 years. The only one who get benefits from infinite consumption is the company. They put ads and created some fashion trends that seduced people to consume, regardless of the pollution during the production process.
 <br><br>

The major problem of numerous waste is made by the company, not the consumers themselves. While company captures the desire of consumers and provided them with some seemingly useful commodities, it is really difficult for consumers to get out of the bait. This situation, however, is not unchangeable. When consumers become rational and being aware of the trap behind the ad, they will not be persuaded by the new product so easily and reduce their consumption. Once the consumption reduces, the corporation will reduce their production, which results in less waste made on the planet.

Reading "The Waste Makers" really opened my eyes about how much harm waste does do our environment. Before, I only really paid attention to the harm that comes from the carbon emissions of all the distribution that occurs within large corporations, like Amazon, H&M, FedEx, etc. But modern society has taught us that once something has "gone out of fashion," then it is no longer socially acceptable to use or display that product. Sure there are some exceptions to this, but this notion has lead to the exponential increase of waste on this planet over the last sixty or so years. 
 <br><br>


However, there is some hope. Some companies have taken some of the waste that consumers leave behind and distribute it to less developed parts of the world. For example, every year for the Super Bowl, the NFL makes a large assortment of apparel for both teams so that they can readily hand them out to the players (as well as selling them to fans) once the game is over and a clear winner has emerged. However, the league takes the merchandise of the losing team and sends it to developing countries so that they can have more clothes to wear (they are probably receiving their "49ers Super Bowl LIV Champions" shirts right about now). This kind of waste redistribution is exactly the kind of work that needs to be done in the world's largest corporations. If H&M spent just as much time doing this as they were streamlining their distribution methods as much as possible, then maybe people would see them in a much better light.

"The Waste Makers" was cool. I always knew people here in America love shopping for products. The things that I read was not too shocking. This reading did point differences between my family and how the rest of America lives. My family always donates clothes or hands them down to a relative that lives Uganda. My family is always about longetivity and effienciency. Our investments have to be meaningful in the sense that it gives us a huge return for a long time. We have had the same lawn mower for almost ten years, maybe more. I am proud that my parents instilled that knowledge in me. The knowledge to always look out for items that can stand the test of time.

Before reading the passage and watching the video, I had already had some kind of knowledge about that some of the companies address some unreal things in their commercial advertisements in order to attract more and more customers. However, after reading the passage, I was still surprised by the examples the author gave us. 
 <br><br>

I had never thought that the consumerism is so powerful now. The behavior of those companies are immoral from my perspective. I can hardly imagine some tobacco companies even treat those young guys as targets just for some interest, although they know the things they sell is bad for health. 
 <br><br>

It seems that some people today just consider about their own interest; they regard money as the most important thing in the world. This can also explain why some fossil fuel companies do not want to agree with the fact that climate crisis and global warming is happening. They even employ some research teams and scientists to help them prove their ideas. Compare with the interest of their companies, they can even sacrifice the future of the environment of the earth. Just as what the professor said in former videos, this is not a scientific problem but a moral problem.

One of the things I find so relevant about the book chapters this week, from “The Waste Makers”, is not actually the text itself, but the quotes at the front of each chapter. Each of these makes an important point about the consumerization of society and acts as an exemplary form of the overall goal of this book, which is to address the negative implications of growing consumerist attitudes and actions. I find the quote in the seventh chapter from Oscar Wilde particularly relevant to this week’s discussion: “Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.” We have discussed how out fashion industry has become such a machine of production and subject to our capitalist consumer system that it must have 52 seasons in a year to meet our consumer ideals. I think Wilde, and many people in the time of writing of this book would find our system of fast fashion absolutely asinine if they already found their 2 seasons of fashion unacceptable. We have grown into this arguable poor system over the past 60 odd years, which was never developed on a sound, viable base to begin with.

I always thought I was crazy or some kind of conspiracy theorist because I felt like things did not really last as they should have, but it makes sense to have things break on purpose. I feel like phones are the biggest offenders of this. Even if phones are not engineered to not last as long, they still come out with one every year and make you believe that you need to get the new one right when it comes out. I remember having a phone for 5 years before it ended up breaking because I feel the need to use a product until it is no longer usable, instead of getting a new product for the aesthetic. Recently though the past three phones I received have not had as long of a time in between, due to reasons other than wanting something more fashionable. I am not one to usually get rid of something that works perfectly fine just because a more fashionable model came out, so I am not affected by obsolescence of desirability, however; it is out of a consumer's control to be affected by obsolescence of quality. At some point, desirability is surpassed by function and thus it makes sense after an undetermined amount of time to upgrade to the next model to make life easier, making the obsolescence of function up to the consumer themselves more than the other two.

After reading "The Wate Makers", I found it interesting how many companies cater to the consumer culture. Car companies like Ford have made their products so that they only last 5 years in hopes that customers will buy the newer or newest model after their car gives out in 5 years. But anyone that has had a Toyota knows, cars can last years if you take good care of them. My roommate drives a '97 Lexus that runs flawlessly. The same goes for Apple, Apple is without a doubt one of the biggest companies of our time. They also know how the consumer mind works, They release a new iPhone every year or so and hype it up so many people feel like they need to buy it, regardless of how their old phone was working. however similary to Ford Apple has all but admitted slowing down their iPhones when they release a new model in hopes that people will assume their old phone is useless and go buy the new one.  
 <br><br>

Everyone is guilty of buying a new phone or new shoes that they really don't need. But it's difficult in this climate, businesses know us and cater to exactly what we want. welcome to the united states of America.

As a whole, I think "The Waste Makers" does an excellent job of illustrating to consumers just how manipulative and deceitful the corporations running our economy have become, and how integral our continued desire to own more than the previous generation is to their success in the present and in the decades to come. To answer Ken’s question about who is responsible for the dramatic increase in consumption over the last couple decades since the 1960s, the very obvious decline of new revolutionary inventions occurring simultaneously with this phenomena points largely to one culprit: capitalistic corporations and their immediate benefactors. 
 <br><br>


When corporations realized that they were largely out of new revolutionary ideas, as stated in "The Waste Makers", they began looking for new ways to convince consumers to buy more, buy faster, buy bigger. The post-war era brought an increase in production technology so great that the consumer demands were more than met. In the present day, corporations are having to manufacture markets within markets, such as with the 52 season year in the case of the fast fashion industry. More and more, other industries are beginning to adopt this model of production and advertisement, all in an attempt to sell their excess of inventory that these new technologies have allowed them to produce. What it all comes down to, as the Waste Makers reiterate, is that our production capabilities have outstripped the consumer market and left us in the face of an economic collapse the likes of which we cannot imagine. 
 <br><br>


Our entire economic system and much of the power this country possesses are deeply and intrinsically linked in the destructive and oppressive structures of capitalism. If the consumers begin to consume less and growth slows, the entire system begins to collapse. What will these corporations do when there is too much supply and no demand? What happens when we stop consuming? The simple answer is: economic disaster. To sum it up simply: these corporations thrive by continually selling the consumer newer and newer versions of a product that will become almost immediately absolute. This is not to say that we the consumers can be completely absolved of guilt for the mass consumption characteristic of the decade, because many of us are allowing it to happen. We buy every new iPhone, replace our laptops every few years, trade in our cars for their newest version even if ours are working just fine, etc. So we must make a conscious effort to reduce our consumption and fight the capitalistic structure that makes it so necessary.

<p>
I really enjoyed reading these chapters from the book. I have always been interested in economics and this books is mostly about economic principles, but also can be related very well to the environment. I previously only thought about planned obsolescence as an economic theory, but now realize that it is environmentally detrimental. If this assignment was not included in this course, I would have probably not made this connection. I am definitely part of the problem of over consuming. Every year the new iPhone comes out I buy it within the first month for no real good reason. My phone always works fine, but I want the new one purely for the fact its new. I do with many other electronics for no reason other than I can and do not want to be "behind". While I am like this with electronics, I am absolutely the opposite with clothes. I would consider myself a minimalist regarding clothes so I have no issue there - admittedly I hate shopping and malls.  
 <br><br>


This book provides more insight into the ideology behind massive companies and how they create a consumer culture. It is almost like propganda. That term might be a little too intense, but they are implanting in our minds that we need the newest items. IF not that, they are literally selling us items that are designed to break or not work within a certain time frame just for us to throw them out and spend more money on new ones. It is an ingenious business model, but also one that is responsible for destroying our planet.  I am more of a fan of items that will last longer and are better quality than to have an item that needs constant maintenance or replacing. The desire for the newest and best "thing" out is not only bad for the planet but bad for our well-being, Things are replaceable, the planet is not.

In line with the information presented in Packard’s “The Waste Makers”, as well as Ken’s introductory video, a huge point elaborated on was corporations’ overwhelming power to make a profit, while harming public health. Something Ken said that stuck out to me was: “unchecked corporations have been willing to do extraordinary things in the name of profit, even knowingly kill people”. This revelation is especially heartbreaking to me because I feel like a lot of people have moved on from the health implications the tobacco industry has done to people’s life expectancies.

As a child of two parents addicted to smoking cigarettes, stemming from their high school days, it makes me wonder if their fate could have been different. I understand that as free-living adults, it is our responsibility to make informed decisions and deal with the consequences. However, corporations create tricky and persuasive propaganda to deflect from the fact that their products are bringing more harm than good. When the camel brand of cigarettes was being pushed with widespread advertising, my young parents could have been lured into thinking that smoking was “cool” and neglected scientific breakthroughs that proved otherwise. The camel brand targeted younger individuals with the memorable logo and carefree language. Similarly, fossil fuel companies are essentially doing the same deflection from the truth; distributing climate change denying literature to teachers comes with admitting that the next generation will be swayed by what they are taught. For example, as Ken mentioned in lecture, cosmetics companies push the social and aesthetic benefits of utilizing their products, often through commercials on kids’ T.V. channels, although the majority of makeup is packaged in unnecessary plastic waste.

After reading the Chapters 2-7 of Vance Packard's "The Waste Makers", I was shocked by the extend of how consumerism has controlled our lives. We human beings are becoming both consumers and waster production machines. Born during the Great Depression, Packard personally opposed the consumerism. He thinks it is a strategy of companies in order to make more people buy their products to make profits. They are trying to make people think that they need more, newer, and more fashionable products which in fact, they don't.
 <br><br>
I was shocked that 400 years ago, there was somebody who knew the problem of our society and was sad that after 400 years, although our world has developed greatly, the consumerism wasn't removed from people's lives, but instead, it becomes deeper. It is influencing more and more people and most of us won't even question whether this trend's legitimacy. 
 <br><br>
One greatest promoter of consumerism is the fashion industry. The whole industry is driven by the concept that the faster they get out new clothes, the faster people will buy them. Hundreds of years ago, there weren't so many fashion brands and trends compared to today's. It's really astonishing that today's fashion industry has around 40 seasons every year which are totally unnecessary. Consumers's minds are being planted by the mindset that they always need new clothes. Their old clothes are no longer wearable if they have lost their fashion meanings. People aren't giving full usage of their clothes and just throw them away. That's how we are creating waste.
 <br><br>
During Ken's video, I was angry towards the example that back to 1960s, there was a cigarette company that used carton figures on the cigarette boxes to attract young consumers. Although the company knows what they are selling is harmful to people's health and the government had already gave out regulations towards advertisements, the company is still doing that disappointing behavior to generate economic profit. 
 <br><br>
The lesson we should take after reading the watching the video is that living in 21st century, we should always be sober when purchasing products. Whether buying it is necessary should be thought by everyone. We should be active towards consuming instead of letting ourselves being controlled by various industries and trends. It's time for us to buy less and think more.

After having to have read some of the chapters of “The Waste Makers”, many of the problems I was already aware of were explained in more detail, but I also learned new information specifically regarding the notion of planned obsolescence, where companies take advantage of the human’s mind, wanting the best, newest gadget in the market. I fear that the only way people are going to change the way they operate is to have consequences or incentives for people to maybe repair their shoes; because unless there is a logical and succinct way for people to go about their daily tasks efficiently, they’re not going to just, out of the kindness of their heart, change the way they operate. It made me think about tech power houses like Apple, and how the trend is for them to release the best, newest phone every year like a cycle to drive sales by captivating human’s desire for the fastest technology. It is truly sad how systematic the problem is, as it means that it is a deep-rooted problem.

This week's reading was very interesting, it really put consumerism and the companies behind this merchandise in perspective. From the very beginning it got me interested in reading more because of the point they made about people needing to buy more stuff if not the economy will weaken. The fact that the economy literally relies on people having to spend tons and tons on disposable clothing and breakable appliances is upsetting; that is what we have become. 
 <br><br>
The parts that were really interesting began in chapter 3, at the mention of how they are coming up with strategies to make Americans more wasteful and compulsive consumers. In chapter 4 those strategies are highlighted; they’re targeting women to spend more on different colored clothes to match their moods or other items of clothing like shoes. Honestly I have to match all the time, from my clothing up to my shoes, so I am included in the people who have been persuaded to spend more on the same clothing but in different colors. I never really stopped to think about how much companies advertise but I do remember that on all types of platforms they are there advertising the websites of clothing you have just visited, making you consider going back to look and eventually buying something. Embarrassingly I have actually done that a couple times.

After finishing the reading, and watching the recap, I looked back on my past mentalities. I realized that our culture and the culture that the corporations want us to have was who I was. Americans are always being manipulated by the corporations to always need to buy a new one.  The new normal is to buy a piece of clothing, wear it for a week, then never wear it again. I used to be like this as well. I never paid attention to the implications of my actions, but through this reading and others in the class, ive realized that I need to continue to change my mentality. 
  <br><br>

I used to be super into cars, but why? A car wont make me or anyone happier. So why did I think that it would? Because I had been brainwashed from the car industry since I was a small kid to belive that cars, and “things” will bring me happiness. With my new ideology, I am much happier and live in the moment instead of clamoring for new “stuff”.

First thing I want to state about “The Waste Makers” is that Vance Packard didn’t mention climate change once throughout chapters 2-7. He did mention how the rate of production is attacking our planet’s natural resources but he did not connect it to the bigger picture of climate change. Considering that this book was published in 1960, it just proves the point that the generation at that time weren’t really aware of global warming and they just grew up thinking this subject isn’t a real issue. Anyways, after reading this text I realized that producers are still forcefully pushing us to consume their products, not even for our happiness but for their own. Sadly, our planet is taking all the hits. In chapter 1, a statement read, “United States industrial firms are grinding up more than half of the natural resources processed each year on this planet for the benefit of 6 percent of the planet’s people” (Packard). I was shocked when I read this because it is insane how the U.S. makes a small part of the planet, yet it consumes resources like if it’s the only important country in the world. No wonder other countries look at us as stuck ups. The fact that this was declared in 1960 is scary because now that it’s 2020, 60 years later, the U.S. could be consuming even more of the earth’s resources than ever before and again, for a small portion of the planet. Furthermore, another good point that Packard brings up in his book is the unnecessary packaging that producers use for food. For example, he states, “The average United States family today spends five hundred dollars of its income each year just for the package!” (Packard). There had been many times where I would go to a store and see how fruits, vegetables, and even small candy would come in a packaging that shouldn't be there. I do understand that it’s all about the presentation and aesthetics so the consumer would purchase it, however it’s just a real waste of resources and it comes off as trying too hard (for me personally). People already throw away food as it is and now adding extra plastic to stuff will just exacerbate things. Unfortunately, this trend hasn’t died off, it’s only getting stronger because we live in a society where appearance is highly valued.

When reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I was really surprised at all the items that we have grown to be massive consumers of. Not only are we consuming more and more things, but this has to do with the company's motives. I feel like last week's lectures had to do with us consuming so much because we simply want the newest things and we want what everyone has at that moment. This is only part of the problem. Some of it has to do with companies purposely making products so that we would have no other choice as to buy replacements. Not only are luxury items being purchased more and more, but necessary items are too because companies make these items so that they will not have a long lifetime. One item that really surprised me that was being purchased more and more were wedding rings. It surprised me because it says that people actually buy new wedding rings to replace the one they already had, such as going for a newer one. I think it is funny because it shows how people value newness rather than sentimentality. I would think that someone would want to keep the wedding ring their spouse got them because it holds value in the form of meaning, but I guess that is not the case for some people. These companies have shaped us into rampant consumers because there are items produced for each and every activity and time of day and we feel we must have them all. Many of the items mentioned would be perfectly fine if we just owned one of them but companies have released multiple types or styles of items and we as consumers feel that we must have them all. We as consumers need to learn that if something works then there is no need to replace it or have multiples. This is something that my friend does that drives me insane. When an item is on sale, she feels the need to buy multiples even though she only needs one. She buys her "backup" and then ends up throwing it away because it goes unused.

This was definitely an interesting read, and it made me think a lot about how consumerism is implemented into our daily life since the moment we can understand anything. I thought about being a child in elementary school, where I remember kids (including myself) thinking they were so cool because they had the big 64 pack of Crayolas. As a child, you see those types of things appear on television and think “I need those!” because this ad is convincing you that you need 64 different crayon colors as if that variety of shades is really gonna make a difference for a child. Many of us do this though. We have this idea that more of something is better even if it isn’t significant. One part of the book made me laugh to myself a bit because it asked how much could things such as a sofa or toaster be improved. I immediately thought of the iPhone when I saw it and how much I see people go from being disgusted by a feature of the newest iPhone yet they still buy it..just to complain about it being no different from their previous one. It’s an odd thing, and even if they aren’t buying it for any “improvements”, they buy it because they have been convinced since being young that newer is better and you absolutely must get rid of old things as soon as the new best thing comes out. We are no different than a child that truly believes they need that 64 pack of crayons, only to end up using the same colors as the normal pack.
  <br><br>

I loved how the author kind of breaks down methods that corporations use to get people to buy more. Connecting this back to the idea that a minimalistic lifestyle makes life better, I definitely see why some people have to practice letting go of what’s not important. It’s extremely hard. Especially when you consider that, because American society is so easily “brainwashed” to buy and buy, people heavily look down upon those who either don’t want to buy the newest things and/or those who just straight up can’t afford it. It doesn’t even seem to matter what actually looks aesthetically pleasing to the eye, it’s how corporations make things look. My family grew up kind of poor so I used to shop at payless and buy Champion, Filas, and I would occasionally buy Vans because they were like $24. Back then, everyone wanted Jordans and bullied kids who didn’t have them or equivalently expensive shoes because they were advertised in such a way (where I lived anyways) that made them seem like any other shoes were bad. Now there’s been a shift, and corporations heavily advertise Vans, Filas, etc. and guess what else you see? Everyone wearing them. My point is, it is extremely hard to make people shift their mindset when, not only are advertisers making people brainwashed, but the people being brainwashed are brainwashing others and creating a cycle of unnecessary spending.

After reading “The Waste Makers,” it just put into perspective the wastefulness of society. It almost made me feel silly for the way I shop and think about things. The beginning chapters took an approach where it simplified the wasteful actions of people, which kind of sounded like it was mocking consumers. It’s interesting to see that even though companies are purposely making things last shorter periods of time, people still continue to buy into these products. Even though the book does talk about how consumerism helped our economy, it has reached a point where the negative effects are starting to outweigh the positive ones. The excessiveness of Americans is only creating a market where companies can create wasteful products and gain profit from it. When this book was written it was already highlighting the issue we have today, which is that one item of something isn’t enough. Propaganda has made us believe that we need more than one of each product. An example that is used in the book is she and he deodorants, whereas, before husbands used to use the same deodorants of their wives. Personally, I didn’t know that was a thing until I read this book, which shows that this way of thinking has been programmed into our heads from a young age where we don’t question buying more than one item of the same thing. Now, it’s rarely heard of a husband sharing the same type of deodorant with his wife. This made me think of the things I own that I have multiples of are really worth it. Are they there to serve an actual purpose or was it just the influence of propaganda that made me buy more than one?

I found this week's reading very interesting.  It was very interesting how it took a look into the economic incentives that gave rise to some of the questionable behaviors of firms in the marketplace.  As well as a term that was mentioned, "planned obsolescence."  This term means, "a policy of producing consumer goods that rapidly become obsolete and so require replacing, achieved by frequent changes in design, termination of the supply of spare parts, and the use of nondurable materials."  I found this to be very bad for many reasons.  The obvious reason being that if a certain item is made so it has to be replaced then it will be contributing to the climate crisis.  Since the item would be made to be replaced and it would become "obsolete" it would force consumers to go out and buy the new item or in the case of clothes... buy the new fashion clothing in stock.  And as Ken stated buying new clothes only contributes to the climate crisis and that is something we do not want to happen.  Adding to "planned obsolescence" there are three different types:  obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability.  Knowing there are three different types of planned obsolescence just goes to show how bad it actually is for the climate crisis.  I had no idea this actually existed, I never imagined that companies actually did this so consumers have to keep going back and purchasing more and more clothing.  It is completely astonishing how this works and how they do it.  Knowing that many people shop nearly everyday just goes to show how bad the climate crisis is actually getting each day.

One of the points that stood out to me was that the Depression in 1950s had a great deal to do with the fast fashion and consumerism. Out of desperation, President Eisenhower literally told people to just "buy anything" to bring the economy up. Of course a country would go into depression because she's at war with another. If we didn't have war, then we wouldn't have this depression. If we didn't have capitalism then we wouldn't have this need to profit, to grow an "economy". 
  <br><br>

As a friend Gabi said, "this world literally profits off of us hating ourselves". If we could just love ourselves and give ourselves and each other space to heal and love. Then we can fight back massive corporations that don't belong here.

This book was absolutely mind blowing. Out of everything we have watched and read in this class so far, this is the first reading that made me forget it was an assignment. I knew that the mindset of advertisers and companies was "convince customer to buy something" but the way that they twist marketing is so manipulative and dirty. It made me so uncomfortable to read it. Reading through the creation and history behind marketing techniques I knew existed but never thought twice about. I was particularly struck by a couple of things.
  <br><br>
To begin with, the use of patriotism as a marketing tool to help stave off recession. I understand that this, unlike some of the other techniques, may have truly been put forward to help bolster the economy and improve the lives of American citizens. But it is ardently disgusting to think of wasteful and gluttonous consumerism to go so hand in hand with Americanism that it is called patriotic. I would love to read more about the continued use of this in terms of the USA vs. Russia situation. "Growth" to beat Russia. Fascinating.  
  <br><br>
Another thing that I did Not like was the idea of "time lag" and this quote that went with. it. "Our enormously productive economy ... demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satis- factions, our ego satisfactions, in consumption....We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced, and discarded at an ever increasing rate.". Ew. I really dont think I need to comment much on this seeing as the quote speaks for itself but I will anyway because I need credit. First off, the vocabulary is sticks out to me. Word like "demands" "way of life" "rituals" "spiritual" and "burned up" feels uncomfortable... religious? I don't want to make the overused metaphor as consumption and money being the American God but it's so obvious that it's glaring the reader in the face. How can anyone say this statement earnestly and not feel corrupted after.

<p>
After reading "The Waste Makers" I now feel like I have a better understanding of economic incentives. It was interesting to read how producers get their consumers to buy products through manipulation. A concept that began not a relatively long time ago now seems to have ruled the consumer industry. the concept being this; Persuade people into thinking that they need the next version of a certain thing or item because they can, or because it is accessible, or (as I've seen with iPhone analogies in many comments before mine) it has a better camera. Packard introduces the concept of planned obsolescence -  and the three different types. As humans and societies have developed we have to transitioned our mindsets to prefer desire over functionalism. In doing so however, we are greatly depreciating the Earth and our ecosystems. We are paying into large and ever growing climate crisis, simply by wanting more, when we already have everything we need. The more we practice obtaining things based on how well they would function for us over how much we really want them, I feel that we can start to greatly reduce our carbon impact.

After reading "The Waste Makers" I was astonished by the techniques these companies use to make sure they are constantly selling more and more of their products. They manipulate the people in order to make them believe that they need these items when in reality they don't. They create products with less quality that will break soon after being purchased this way the buyer will buy another one and another one in an endless cycle.  Another strategy used is when they "improve" a product they are selling. Many times the improvement is very minor or inconvenient that will lead the consumers to buying even more stuff. However because these brands are "cool" people will spend the amount of money needed even though the thing they are buying is not necessary. And what happens to all the products that are replaced by the new ones, most of them are thrown away. So when items, as phones where a new one comes out each year or clothes where there are now 52 season of new selections, are no longer new or trendy they are piling up on the earth where they are just adding on to the waste in the environment.

When reading "The Waste Makers", it was almost comical how alike our society is today with that of the 1950s-1960s. The consumer culture that is described by Vance Packard's book is almost identical, especially when its comes to things such as fast fashion, planned obsolescence, and technological innovations. In both time periods, new fashion trends are constantly spewed out whether it is the different colored stockings for different moods in the 50s, or cheap $10 shirts sold by H&M today. Another comparison is with planned obsolescence in which back then cars were built to only last you a max of 10 years with pristine care whereas by comparison today, you would be lucky to not have your smartphone's battery not die on you within 4 years. This tactic of forced consumerism to get you to constantly having to replace your old gadgets is still shockingly prevalent after 70 years, and its quite frankly deceptively disgusting. Finally, innovation in certain departments also has significantly slowed down and has seen almost no improvements. In the 50s, general house appliances such as the washing machine couldn't be improved any further, and today, the smartphone seems to have hit its peak design as a metal rectangle with a glass touchscreen. It is almost a scary question to ask, but will the reality of consumerism in America established by Packard be something almost impossible to revert? Are we really this blind to the tricks that many of this companies are pulling on us? This is honestly a book that I feel everyone should read so they can be more aware about their spending habits and to prevent the gluttony that currently plagues our world.

“The Waste Makers” was a really interesting reading. It provided a lot of insight to the way America’s economy was transformed. After the War, the United States realized that its economy was dependent on the large consumption of the American citizens during the war, but this was declining as people did not have the necessity to buy more things. Vance tells us that the only way to maintain a stable economy and rise even further could only be achieved if we spend more and more each year. During the 1950’s, the producer had the hard task to produce products that the public would consume. However, they did not have the necessary technology to build and develop more products. Industries realized that they had to force consumption into Americans’ lives, but how? One of the techniques employed by companies was to change the color of their products promoting a certain characteristic. By doing this, they made people think that the new color of the product was better than the previous one and that they needed it. They also promoted that the public needed two things of everything: two fridges, two telephones, two houses. By doing so, people acquired multiple things of the same product just to show that they were economically stable. One important idea that stuck with me was this idea of obsolesce. Obsolescence basically is this idea of putting a “death date” for a product so the consumer would need to replace for a new one. I thought that obsolescence was a really immoral thing to do because we would do things that would eventually stop working while we still had to pay. However, is it really a bad thing to do? Our economy literally depends on it. Luckily, producers have developed and followed a “better” type of obsolescence that Vance supports: Obsolescence of desirability. Basically, industries make us believe through advertisements that the product we currently have—still in good conditions—is obsolete and needs replacement. This is not as bad as it sounds as it depends on us to whether or not to believe this. Is this the right thing to do though?

<p>
For a while now, I have been wondering how our culture-and others alike-can knowingly consume an unnecessary amount of things. Myself, for example: Before I found out about fast fashion and e-waste about a year ago, I use to always be consuming. The weird part was, part of me knew I didn’t need any of the things I was buying, but it’s almost like I was not in control of my thoughts or actions (of course I was, but growing up in an ad-filled world made me feel otherwise). The reading for this week is by far my favorite from the course! When I get time, I plan on reading the rest. I thought this article did an amazing job of explaining the economy in ways ALL readers can understand. My response for this week is a little long because there were so many quotes that I felt were great and needing addressing.
  <br><br>
“If you are a producer and most families already own your product, you are left with three possibilities for making further sales. You sell replacements; you sell more than one item to each family; or you dream up a new or improved product-or one that at least seems new or improved-that will enchant families that already own an "old" model of your product. (A fourth possibility is to move into a different line)” (page 24). This quote hit me hard because I realize that a lot of my purchasing falls under ALL of these categories. Secondly, “Corporation made a notably candid statement. He said: ‘The industry has wrung the last possible ounce of research out of the present appliance products. We can only offer prettier equipment.’ He urged the industry to start basic research in the THE NAGGING PROSPECTS OF SATURATION 13 properties of clothing and meats in order to come up with radically new products.” (24-25). This quote related a lot to me because I realized my dad is trapped greatly by the idea of “newer and prettier.” Every time I visit my dad (who was born in the 50’s), he has the newest Keurig, the newest TV, the newest office desks/chairs, ect…all because he says the old stuff (a year old) was “outdated.”  
  <br><br>
I never really realized the economic strategies behind consumerism. I also kind of knew that ads were the reasons behind a lot of brainwashed consuming, but I never knew how much our economy “depends” on it:  “The United States economy-is depending on the willingness of consumers and the government to spend more each year than they have the preceding year. Some economists suggest that whenever United States citizens fail to step up their over-all consumption by at least 4 per cent in any given year they are inviting a ‘failure-to-grow recession’” (page 33). On this note, it was mentioned several times that our economy has now reached a point where production is out doing consumerism...has this every happened before and how is the economy expected to respond? 
  <br><br>
My last thought is about iphones: My very first iphone was the iphone 5C. To this day, I always tell people I would still have that phone if it didn’t break. I now have the iphone 10. Not by choice. I thought I was paranoid when I started realizing every time a new iphone came out, my current iphone would ask me to update it and when I did, it would start to not work…things would be slow… apps wouldn’t work right…it would freeze…which forced me to move on to the next iphone. Recently, I have been trying to hold onto my iphone for atleast 3 years before I get a new one-and even then, I don’t really need a new one at all. I often have people ask “what iphone number is that?” with a disgusted face while they’re holding the iphone 3000…it just makes me realize it will never stop and that there are so many sneaky strategies within companies.

"The Waste Makers" provides us with a glimpse into how economic incentives give rise to some of the more questionable and peculiar behaviors of firms in the marketplace. One major force pushing firms to invest in strategies to construct a society of aggressive consumerism is that manufacturing capability had sky rocketed shortly after WWII, and thus a push to utilize the extra productive capabilities took place. In addition to this, Packard also mentions that the stock market has a surprising link with the state of U.S. foreign conflict to the point where the notion of a "peace scare" existed during the cold war. The truth of this pressure became ever more transparent when President Eisenhower made a speech with the simple message of encouraging citizen's to get out in the market and buy. 

  <br><br>

While I'm clearly not an economist or expert in any field to any capacity, I certainly trust the perspective of the people and the environmentally conscious that the rampant consumerism has had profoundly negative effects on our planet. Something must be said about the sick incentive system in place when the lives of people are put at stake to feed the need of U.S. economy. Economy is not an essential aspect of life, the planet and a habitable earth however are. Insisting on the survival of the economy over the environment sounds like absolute insanity, and from all sources presented thus far in class, the reality. 
  <br><br>


I used to often hear my dad and grandparents make remarks regarding PC updates and premature falters of their cellphones and such, but I often disregarded it as some flavor of paranoia. As a STEM major myself, I felt as if I knew the power of technology wasn't limitless and that the components of a cellphone or other products are bound to begin to see a decline after some time. However, this book definitely illuminated the fact that some suppliers certainly do manufacture premature failure into their products. In fact, as Packard mentions, there has been research that has gone into investigating the behavior of consumers in order to construct a society of insatiable consumers.

Possibly my most striking realization from reading The Waist Makers was that my understanding of why the house where I grew up had closets full of unused items and unworn clothing. I had always assumed that the reason why there was simply so much stuff in my house was because that was the way things were supposed to be--if clothing tore or started to fade you would put it in a box in the basement, not throw it out and certainly not attempt to have it repaired. When a new appliance came out it was natural to simply throw the older one away without regard to the fact that it was still working. A naturally disgusting feeling stemming from my reading is that the reason why my family did these things and why I now do these things is because some man in a Mad Men esq building in the fifties and sixties decided that people needed to own more in order to increase production. People were convinced to waste their money and did so merrily for social clout or their own lack of regard to the power of consumer goods. As this idea developed into the theme of planned obsolescence, its effect on my life is now clear. When buying clothing or goods my mind always rests on how good it looks or how good it works, not if it will last long or be durable. What is even more strange is thinking about how companies today can revert from this accepted principle to sell even more goods, as outdoor companies like Patigonia and REI are using “durability” as the standard for their goods. I just feel gross thinking about how something about my life is just so accepted and normalized, it feels like a betrayal of my trust and an influence that corporations have on my life that I am not truly comfortable with.

After reading, “The Waste Makers”, I felt pretty hopeless, but at the same time aware of the toxic consumer culture that our society has accustomed to. Major corporations are truly manipulating us from a young age to become the consumers that they want us to be by using advertisements and pop culture to spread their message. These consumers are unaware of the amount of unreasonable goods they are buying and want things at the tip of their fingers.
  <br><br>

 Reading this 1960 study reminded me of when the first Iphone came out and the years later after it came out. I remember when my dad had first bought the Iphone and being so intrigued by such a revolutionary model of the average cell phone. I immediately wanted one at the young age of 8 years old. I did not know it at the time but Apple was already making me a future consumer of their products by having apps on the Iphone for kids. Each year my dad would buy the new Iphone and I thought nothing of it, other than he was just going with the times. Today, looking back, I see how Apple has made me into the consumer I am today especially with Apple products. Although I do not get the newest Iphone every year, I do get a sense of anxiety when a new one comes out and I still have a version from a few years ago. This is not a normal way of feeling about products and is definitely the mindset of an American consumer. We, as a society, should be getting products that we need or know will use for years and years, rather than getting products just to be in style or with the times. Our consumer culture must change soon for the well being of our planet and I will be doing my part in consuming and wasting less.

“ The Waste makers” describe many negative impacts of consumerism in the 1960s. The author mentioned that the induce of automated equipment and expansion of U.S productive facilities contribute to the era of consumerism. The economy mainly depends on people’s consumption so that most companies use different kinds of media to advertise their products and advocate people to follow the trend and consume more. Meanwhile, people showed great desirability of owning new and innovative stuff and motivated producers to produce more. For example, the fashion industry has 52 seasons per year to satisfy the need of consumers and producers. Also, the government encourages farmers to plant more and storage in order to create artificial prosperity. It seemed that the productive capacity was useless and such property sustained by consumers. The innovation of cans allowed more storage and led to more consumption and the design of new and modern equipment usually needs more batteries and electricity. In other words, Americans consume more than they should and all their actions will have a harmful and irreversible impact on the environment.

All through my life, I've always heard my dad say something I never believed. He always complained and continues to complain that things just are not built the way they were built before. I never quite believed him. It's common sense that it couldn't be true, I thought. How could humans, who have grown to be able to do spectacular and magical things with science, be working backwards? And so I never believed until I realized the truth is a lot more complicated through this reading, "The Waste Makers." 
  <br><br>

To me, there was a point that resonated with me the most. The fact that people contemplated making products so that they would stop working after a certain amount of time seemed ridiculous and cruel. An opponent to planned obsolescence summed it up quite nicely when he said engineers wouldn't like it either if the products they were buying were built like this too. Of course they wouldn't like it. Our country has transformed along with the products it makes and consumerism. This study helped me learn some of the ways this happened and the amount of waste we are creating as an effect of obsolescence. We need to learn how to live without going through as much.

The idea of planned obsolescence really does sound ridiculous the more you think about it, doesn’t it? Though “The Waste Makers” was a really insightful and interesting reading, maybe even my favorite reading assigned to us so far, some of the methods that Packard lists that were used to entice consumers sounds more like a conspiracy theory than a sales tactic. Two of the tactics from this reading that fascinated me were the use of color to get people, especially women, to buy more aesthetic products and the emphasized idea that “one isn’t enough.” I agree with your ending point that we need to learn how to live without going through temporary material things; in the end, it would benefit our planet, after all. Consumer culture is so deeply ingrained in our society, though, so I hope we’ll be able to effectively undo at least some of the effects that consumerism has had on us.

When I see the first sentence of chapter 2, I am convinced by what he says. “Today, the average citizen of the United States is consuming twice as much in the ways of goods as the average citizen consumed in the years just before world war II. Nearly two-fifths of the things he owns are thins that are not essential to his physical well-being.” I can sense that each person’s consumption has risen a lot in comparison to what we consumed before. And I remind of my parents’ era, they didn’t buy a lot of things than us do. When they have all the essentials and some extras, they feel happy. We can be the same. By having essentials, we can buy some commodities we like and I don’t think we need to buy a lot of them. Happiness is not given by overconsumption
  <br><br>

Plus, if you are a producer when most families own your products, you can produce a new model to enchant the families. It reminds me of clothes brans and mobile phone brands. For clothes brands, they continually advertise new fashions and styles each spring, each summer and even each holiday. For phone brands, like Oppo in China and Apple in the US, they have the highest speed and awareness to promote and manufacture new phones each year or each half year. These factors push consumers living in a world that is full of new attractive products. Everyone tells you that you need to buy it and it is cool and it is great. That’s why we have more and more people who are trapped by consumerism and sugar-coated candies. I hope people are aware of the fact and grow a sense of independence to own knowledge and thoughts instead of consumption that can fulfill their life.

I liked that Ken started us out on Chapter 2 so we could read that quote first. I also am totally convinced by it. Especially that nearly 2/5 of the things we own are not essential to our physical well-being. We have so many things now and bigger houses to fit all of those things. My paren’t also grew up in this era and they would have the essentials and a few extra things that made the happy. But these things were made to last. One time a song came on a commercial, it went “Ive got a brand new pair of roller-skates you’ve got a brand new key.” I was puzzled by this and then my mom shed some light. She said that when she was growing up she had one pair of roller-skates and you would insert the key in the bottom to make them longer / shorter so you would grow with them, hence buying less. But soon after they started making roller-skates in different sizes and colors and patterns in order to generate more sales. And there are so many other examples of this in the Waste Makers reading. Potato peelers started being made the color brown so people would accidentally throw them away with the potato skins and needing to buy another one. 


  <br><br>

We must go back to this idea of making things to last if we want to make a change. We don’t need new appliances every year in order to match the color scheme of our rooms. We don’t need a new phone just because a new version came out. And we don’t need new clothes just because they are on sale or “in” right now. We need clothes meant to last years that can be easily and cheaply repaired. We need phones that are meant to last instead of companies like Apple making phones that are meant to break and not work years after. We must change the way things are systematically if we want to see these changes. And it starts with our choice to consume, so consume less and only consume what you need and brings you joy.

This book genuinely helped me understand how much attempt is placed into making Americans  purchase an ever increasing number of things. Particularly with shopping centers, I have an inclination that it's so natural to be enticed to surrender to customer culture. We're constantly given new things and the way that what's "in" and "out" of style changes so every now and again clarifies how much purchaser culture affects us. We're continually hanging tight for the following best thing and attempting to consistently remain in style, yet it's very destructive to our condition and that is the thing that we neglect to figure it out. 
  <br><br>
Our shopper culture has a method for keeping things so quick paced that once another thing gets mainstream or polished, it goes on for a piece. Most patterns keep going for a piece and afterward they leave following a couple of months. 
  <br><br>
"The Waste Makers," Vance Packard features a portion of the underhanded methods of large organizations in the realm of industrialism we live in. While commercialization is frequently observed as a huge issue in our general public, individuals will in general spotlight on the issues in regards to the shoppers, as opposed to those of organizations that are eventually benefitting from the helplessness of buyers. Through impeccably curated commercials, organizations are causing individuals to accept that they need some item or thing, when as a general rule, this need doesn't exist. Arranged out of date quality is an incredibly valuable strategy used by organizations constantly, helping them gain apparently uncertain enthusiasm of the customer populace.

After reading "The Waste Makers," it showed me how companies marketed. I never really thought much about the overproduction of items in the market. The improvements that these companies claim to have made are really subtle and honestly, they just take up more space on this planet in contrast to their actual use. An example they used would be stoves. The "improvements" to the stove were useless. They would just take up more space and have more buttons. That's about it. Companies even got desperate to the point where they would show up to your door claiming to be "furnace engineers" or with the government so they can replace your furnace. 
  <br><br>


Many items, like glasses, would come in various styles just so that people can buy more. Companies would have slogans that would push you to keep buying more. It was a norm that items need to match your clothes. This led to an abundance of items, just in various styles. Another point mentioned in the book was obsolescence. Items like lipgloss wouldn't be able to push the remaining of the lipgloss up, therefore being obsolete. This would cause customers to go out and buy more.

It is quite offputting how we were raised into this society and considered all this to be normal. As you put it, we shouldn't accept this to be our norm. Business companies purposely manipulate our lives to benefit their personal agenda of making a profit. Therefore, it is quite critical that we know how businesses are targetting us for us to make a decisive decision of whether or not we truly need and perhaps want these products without thinking about the psychological message manufacturing companies are trying to fool us into. The examples you provided are great examples that highlight the tactics implemented by companies that the text does a great job at explaining.

This idea of planned obsolescence is not even only applicable to adult consumers, but even shows in consumerism for young children. Toys are constantly being put on the market, and they become popular through extreme amounts of commercialism to the point that children are constantly begging their parents for new toys or games. And this process is only solidified when people start buying into it, thus instilling jealously in children when other kids have something they do not. It even pulls parents into the scheme, as parents will want to give their kids as much (if not more) than other fellow parents are giving their kids. This goes back to the idea of humans constantly trying to one-up one another, and to “prove” their worth through material goods. 
   <br><br>

And this flies by the eyes of even the most diligent consumers, as it is difficult if not impossible to notice the tricks that are being pulled on us. They have been instilled in our society for decades, and our society has allowed this to happen for so long that it is becoming more and more difficult to reverse.

It is true that people tend to buy more stuff when more advertisements come to show up. It is a new way of propaganda. Fabulous clothes drive many people crazy especially for teenagers and women. This is a trending in recent years. When you walk along the street, you can always see a lot of SALE signs in stores like H&M and Zara. People will attracted by this sale sign easily and buy a huge amount of clothes. That causes much waste. People hold different opinions: some people think buying too much will cause a lot of burden for the environment, while others think fashion should always be parts of our daily lives. While I think, we should not buy too much clothes for the environment.

It truly is unsettling how marketing and overproduction have become so normalized in the United States that Americans now justify the amount they buy and find it completely necessary to have more than one of the same thing. What I've never understood was how willing Americans are to throw something away once an object shows its first signs of wear and tear. Despite it being much easier (and cheaper) for someone to repair an object, they would much rather throw the entire thing away so there is an excuse to purchase another one. When Packard wrote that engineers were being chastised for giving products too long of a life, and thus had to purposely worsen the quality, I was unfortunately disappointed but not surprised. The same goes for the lipgloss example that you mentioned, obsolescence is now built into everything we own and it is not going away unless there is a complete change on production and marketing in the United States.
<br><hr>
In reading “The Waste Makers” and in studying for the midterm prior to doing the week’s assigned reading, the term obsolescence really peaked my interest, like yours. I had never heard this word, but guessing from the root ‘obsolete,’ I figured it must have to do with things becoming useless. In short, I found that the term refers to how, in our culture, corporations design products to ultimately become obsolete in some way, forcing consumers to purchase more. Looking deeper into this concept, the main types of obsolescence utilized by corporations  include aesthetic, functional, and economical. Although I had never thought about companies strategically making products to one day become useless to the consumer, reading about this concept made so much sense. I immediately related this concept to the way in which Apple creates a new iPhone every year and is constantly pumping out new and improved products. I’ve had iPhones that have lasted me around three to four years, so why would I need a new one every single year? Well, to some it is a must because it may have a better camera, longer battery life, new colors, etc. In coming out with a new and better model every year, Apple is creating aesthetic obsolescence in their older models. The old ones don’t have the same wow factor as the new ones, which makes the new models irresistible to many consumers. There are millions of other companies just like Apple who use this marketing technique to increase sales and profits, and almost none are considering the impact of such devastating amounts of production and waste on the environment and changing climate.

I think an interesting way that people of today's society can counteract these decades of extreme consumerist culture is to make do with the overabundance of produced items already in the economy by means of thrifting or trading. It's already become something of a trend in today's youth to thrift and shop online for used clothes through apps such as poshmark, and this method of acquiring used items allows those growing up in a consumerist culture to fulfill that cultural need to buy and consume without contributing to needless waste.
   <br><br>


In general, while I wholeheartedly agree that vast cultural change must occur in order for our planet to be saved, I don't think the approach of pushing for extreme change as soon as possible and settling for nothing less is plausible. Like it or not, the human race is strongly opposed to change, and in order to actually change the world we must find ways to slowly shift the public's lifestyles in small steps and substitutions towards the real end goal of truly sustainable living, but simply charging headfirst toward massive cultural change does not seem feasible to me.

<br><hr>

I totally agree with what you have said in your comment and think that the stove is a great example of the developments we see in certain products available in our modern world. I have seen the iPhone used as another example in several other comments and think it is probably one that we are all very aware of in our everyday lives. In addition to the iPhone itself, we have been swayed into purchasing a number of accessories to accompany our phones including cases, screen protectors, pop sockets, etc. Many of these items are quite useful in prolonging the “life” of an iPhone; therefore, preventing the owner from having to purchase or replace parts of the device prior to its final inability to be used. You of course cannot predict the “life” of your iPhone as there is a reputation of “lemon” iPhone but when purchasing accessories there is a more "sustainable" way to shop. If we became more conscious consumers we would be able to lean towards more conscious purchases such as one phone case that we hope will last us until the phone can no longer be used. This would involve investing in something a bit more expensive to avoid purchasing several cheaper, poor quality items as Ken briefly touched upon in lecture when discussing clothing purchases.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, in that I never thought about companies dealing with overproduction by simply marketing and advertising the public to solve the problem for them; I always thought that they just would produce slightly more than was demanded at the time to allow room for growth, and then wait a while, and repeat. Upon further analysis, the former, more accurate model allows for more profit, as the company would never have to deal with running out of an item that the public still demanded, and therefore it makes sense why, in a capitalistic economy driven strictly by profit margins, a company would prefer it to the latter. Moreover, a company marketing its product in a way to encourage people to purchase several copies or versions of it is ingenious in a way, as it eliminates any way that profits can cap out when the whole public has purchased the item. Not having a ceiling on how much money a company can make is obviously in the company's best interest, so again it makes sense why they opt for this route.
    <br><br>

In terms of planned obsolescence, again companies capitalize on the insecurities that customers may have because they do not have the "newest" or "best" product. In reality, if it works just as well, why upgrade to the newest Macbook from your old laptop? There really is not a reason other than the drive to fit in with your peers, or at the very least flaunt your wealth (that you may not even have). In thought, one might think that consumers and producers have sort of a mutualistic relationship; consumers buy products from the producers, giving the producer money in exchange for a product that provides a service. Throughout this reading it became much more clear to me that the relationship is much more similar to that between predator and prey. The prey, the consumer, does everything they can to try and solidify themselves as part of a larger, more elite group, whereas the predatorial companies do everything they can to herd the consumers into acting the way they want, so they can ultimately pounce on them, taking their money for a product they do not need. The development of advertising in the last 70 years exemplifies this predatory relationship that proves the drive for profit is more important than anything else for major companies.
<br><hr>
I agree with your idea. In the passage, the author Vance Packard shows that consumerism in America had become prevalent after the second World War. All the factories and producers was spreading the one idea: Buy more and enjoy more. They tried to persuaded the public happiness could be brought by consumption, which they did successfully achieve their target. Because of their contribution, Americans nowadays are buying more and more. In order to make people keep buying things, the factories need to “improve” their product to attract their consumers, which is simply making their product bigger and fancier. 
    <br><br>

However, these improvement do not change the basic function of the product. Just like you mention the bigger stove, every time our apps and system on our electronic device need to upgrade, it basically is occupying more internal storage and slowing our devices down. This will force us to buy a new one. All other products are doing the same thing to increase their sales. As we increase the speed of wastage and consumption, it will cause a numerous of wast of resource and is destroying the natural environment.


<br><hr>


I was similarly surprised to think about how the idea of "technological improvements" has changed over the decades. Things like laundry machines and stoves, when first invented, meant a huge improvement for the lives of many Americans. They were incredibly convenient, freed up time and generally helped add value to a housewife and mother, for example. Now, improvements made to push more and more products onto consumers consist of things like adding space and buttons, features that don't really add much value to the user of the product. This reminded me of the Minimalism documentary where one of the Minimalists mentioned that we need to reconsider how the things we own add value to our lives. The companies that suggest that every person needs multiple pairs of glasses and won't notice obsolescence in the things we buy are banking on the idea that we do not evaluate our belongings that way.

I feel like one of the most important reasons for our waste making is the companies’ drive for profit. As it was said in the book, the companies will do anything to advertise the product to the consumers, not thinking about their health or about being morally correct. Unfortunately, in today’s world, capital is more important than basic human relationships. 
    <br><br>
“The United States economy-is depending on the willingness of consumers and the government to spend more each year than they have the preceding year.” This quote shows a lot about modern life. Apple, for example, recently started to release two “different” phones, and there is no doubt that it was done to increase their profit. Moreover, it is also being done to convince the consumer that every year there is something better than what they have at this point in time. And when I think about the scale of such production – millions of phones every year – it makes me scared about our future, because people will keep buying and believing that every year there will always be something new and better. Our society is very wasteful, and only knowledge about the production can change the opinions of many of whether they still want that new phone or not. All the other steps in producing a product should be known and told to a customer. In my opinion, this should not even be voluntarily, and when not told, a company should be fined.

"Style can destroy completely the value of possessions even while their
    <br><br>
utility remains unimpaired," said Paul Mazur. I had thought little of the influence that style has on my life as an individual, but after reading "The Waste Makers," that changed. 
    <br><br>

The idea of planned obsolescence of desirability, that products will soon become 'worn out' in the minds of consumers because of a style or trend mentality, is so applicable to today. The iPhone, for one, is a prime example. Sometimes I wonder when Apple will run out of innovative ideas for the next iPhone; it appears that as new versions come out, the new technology appears to be less revolutionary than the last time. But as Mazur says, the style mentality keeps the demand for new iPhones up; people will quickly devalue their current possessions as new styles emerge. Regardless of how revolutionary the new technology is, consumers' desire for new things will keep people buying new iPhones. 
    <br><br>

It's also interesting to see how the inception of rampant consumer culture after the Second World War influences our consumer behavior today. While I've been brought up valuing the things I own, there is definitely the allure of just buying more things. It's really easy to do, and in fact, my entire family has a habit of doing it. Not only the low price of things, but the ease of delivery through Amazon Prime shipping only perpetuates consumer culture. My family has bought into that wholeheartedly -- I cannot wait to go home to tell them how this only makes our carbon footprint bigger than it already is.
    <br><br>

However, it's comforting to understand why our culture exists. To answer Ken's question, I don't consider it the consumer's fault; we've been manipulated by corporations to change our consumer habits. Reading "The Waste Makers" will make it easier for me, however, to change my behavior to a more minimalist approach; I feel more inclined to resist the greed-based claims of corporations who urge me to buy, buy, buy.

I agree with your comment, it is comforting to understand our culture but at the same time you can't help but remain frustrated at how we have been so easily misguided. This rampant consumerist culture is unfortunately a part of our culture, ingrained in almost everything we do. From our clothes, foods, to our technology - we live in a constant cycle of renovation - no matter how small the changes are. Like you commented, the iPhone is a prime example of "planned obsolescence" - where your perfectly functioning phone suddenly becomes undesirable.  We have become so used to the limited lives of our technology and we don't even realize it. I to have been influenced by this fast pace interchange of technology. I remember when I had am iPhone 8 plus and I was dying to get my hands on an iPhone X. The only thing that was truly notable between the phones were the home screen button and the camera. And the difference wasn't even that great. So, I completely understand how most of the nation even the world fall prey to these kinds of industries that rely on planned obsolescence.


<br><hr>
Your example about new iPhone each year is on point. I remember iPhone 4 being the one phone that is the most revolutionary for me, and then each year after that they just all seem about the same, nothing essential changed. It's always the new upgrades on hardware, or newer software  and systems that no longer support the older version of iPhone. I simply never understand how companies like Apple keep raising people' desires to change their stuffs every year until now, Style. As you said products always "worn out" in consumers' mentality because companies make them so. 
    <br><br>

They recorded appealing short films that showcase a cooler style for their products, they planted the idea that newer version is always better, and not getting the better version will be a lost, despite they tend to not show us truly  "how much better" it is, or we never learn to ask "what does 'that much better' actually mean for me?". Sometimes greedy companies even produce low quality products in hopes consumers break them fast and would want to get their hands on newer, better products.

    <br><br>

It's definitely the industries manipulate on consumer's culture, but I would argue that at first, at least a couple generations before, right after end of WWII came a long period of peace, there were a genuine consumers' demands that contributes to what our industries look today. Maybe the younger generations like us had no choice or never questioned about our actions, those corporations shouldn't take all the blames. Although it is true that to change our life-style and culture, we are going against the industries' wills, as the ways of earning fast money is just so addicting.

<br><hr>

I really love the way you phrased your sentence about planned obsolescence of desirability. As consumers, we believe that new is better and this mentality feeds into the vicious cycle of consumerism that spurs people to buy more and more. Your reference to the iPhone is one that I completely agree with! It seems like every time a new phone comes out, another one is about to be released next. It baffles me because the difference between the models are so minuscule yet people will flock to stores in massive lines to get the new phone. The irony is most people who are in a rush to get the new model have perfectly working phones.  
    <br><br>

I personally love to buy things and like you mentioned, the ease of Amazon Prime only makes it harder to resist. Consumerism is increasingly becoming easier to participate in, and most worrisome, without much thought. Amazon's ability to provide a huge selection of items in one centralized website and its rapid shipping times, makes filling up your cart and purchasing happen within seconds.
     <br><br>
At least with malls, which are dying at a rapid pace, you have to sort through items to find what you're looking for, get into line, and pay at a register. With online shopping, one search can take you to exactly what you're looking for and with another click, it's yours.
    <br><br>

I agree with your stance on Ken's question. It is not the consumer's fault because as a society, people are constantly bombarded by advertisements and material wealth. "The Waste Makers" makes me reflect on my own shopping habits, which can most definitely be improved. It is important to me that I am conscious of my purchases and that the things I buy and own genuinely bring me happiness.

<br><hr>

I completely agree with your response. I find it quite scary that societal trends can have such an impact on our consumer purchases and furthermore it shocks me that we devalue our possessions with almost no thought simply based of the opinions of others. I remember growing up I was always taught to be unique and break outside of the box, in terms of my personality, my style, my thoughts in an attempt to try to bring something new to the table. However, in retrospect, I feel as though I've been a basic participant in this rampant consumer society and haven't questioned the ways in which I've been conditioned to conformity. 
    <br><br>

Similar to you, I believe it is the coperations fault for influencing the consumer to want more. It is in human nature to want the best and newest innovations because of our competitive nature, however the cheap and convenient access to these items is what creates the issue of rampant consumerism. The increased production of consumer items after World War II has created this demand to purchase and oftentimes I even find myself buying items I don't need simply because I'm bored and it has been engrained in me that shopping is for entertainment, not for necessities. This is what is wrong with our current societial views towards consumer good is that we are taught to use until they don't bring enjoyment then throw them away with no afterthought. I appreciate the perspective that "The Waste Makers" brought about and hope that more people will become aware of the extreme detriment that modern consumerism has on the environment.

I completely agree with your example of how the iPhone is manufactured with planned obsolescence of desirability. At this point, Apple is releasing new versions of iPhones every couple of years that don’t add new benefits or change previous versions in substantial ways - for example, the recent iPhone that came out which has an extra camera lens. Their products also don’t seem to last for a long time; from personal experience, the battery drains very quickly over time and the phones themselves aren’t well-protected. The obsolescence of quality is another factor that is very apparent in today’s society. Consumerism has made it so that we expect items that should last us for a while to break after a couple years of medium usage. The mentality that everything is replaceable and that it’s better to buy items that are marginally cheaper and will last for a shorter period of time than slightly more expensive yet durable products is extremely harmful for ourselves and our planet. Collectively, we have so much stuff that we don’t need. The waste generated from all of this consumption is also making a negative impact on the environment, and the continuous production of these replaceable items are diminishing Earth’s resources. This is why I find Vance Packard’s perspective that everything should be used completely very refreshing. If society held this mentality, products today would be made to last. 
    <br><br>
The shift in perspective that occurred after the second world war was ultimately very harmful to today’s society and environment, but it shows how consumerism inherently is a wasteful and superficial economic order. One of things I found most interesting in “The Waste Makers” was how the government encouraged people to buy a surplus of things following the Great Depression in order to make the economy stronger, and how creating more and more superfluous items for consumers to buy ultimately led to the capitalistic and product-driven economy that we have today. Ultimately, our current model is unsustainable in the long run. I agree that it isn’t the consumer’s fault, but that of the large corporations that profit off of sweatshop labor. We need to be reusing items, upcycling clothing, and building durable items that will last the consumer much longer than they are now. Otherwise, our wasteful culture will continue to harm the planet and will make the fight against climate change much harder.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your answer to Ken's question, as it is the corporations and larger capitalist system at fault for this excessive consumerism, not the consumers. Living within a rigid capitalist and consumer-based society makes it hard if not impossible to escape the expectations, values, and habits associated with it. "The Waste Makers" as well as the whole class in general has made a much more conscious consumer, as I know better now than to buy into the obsolescence of desirability and advertising tricks. We are tricked by corporations and media into thinking that these consumer habits are good for us, when in reality they are only good for those corporations' accumulation of profit and detrimental to us and the environment. These companies will do anything that gives them more money, even by purposely designing products that will wear down soon so you'll go and buy the newest version again. This increases the amount of things we consume, and consequently increases the amount of waste we leave behind as well.

Most people remember this scene after watching the movie The Wolf of Wall Street. The protagonist asked his friend to sell him a pen. His friend, instead of bragging how well-made this pen was, asked him to sign on a paper. That is the selling technique that the protagonist tried to advocate and proved successful throughout his life. 
    <br><br>

It is what those major companies tried to create within us customers in order to profit. A need to own something. They link commercials with Ideas of being beautiful, fit or successful so that when people take something from the shelf, they are not just attracted by the functions of this product, but instead attracted by the image of themselves becoming the person they want to be after owning this merchandise.

However, people who bought a treadmill might left it in a corner of the house just weeks after owning it. Not everyone who bought these machines became fit and healthy but one thing is certain that the carbon footprint they produced by consuming this product doesn’t go away easily. Thus, we are subconsciously becoming waste makers manipulated by the manufacturers.

I agree with what you said regarding the idea of planned obsolescence of desirability, especially concerning iPhones. I still had my iPhone 6 when the iPhone X came out because my iPhone 6 was still useful to me at that point as it functioned normally. Therefore, I saw no need to upgrade. However, there were multiple times where people would comment on my iPhone 6 and asked me when I would buy the latest iPhone. 
    <br><br>

I am, however, guilty of participating in the rampant consumer culture. I bought many items that I did not need to have solely because the item was on sale. It gives me happiness to know that I got an item at a discount. Therefore, when there is a sale, I spend more money and buy more items than I intend, which is horrible from an environmental standpoint. 
    <br><br>

I also believe that it is comforting to understand why our culture exists and that the corporations are responsible for the consumer’s habits through their manipulation. By understanding why our culture exists, we are presented the opportunity to change that culture in a way that benefits the environment. I am currently working on recognizing these manipulative tactics to avoid mindlessly spending money on items that I do not need.


<br><hr>
I am genuinely surprised and infuriated that we, not only as environmentally conscious people, but as consumers, allow planned obsolescence to continue at the rate and scale that we do. Not only does this problem have a profound effect on our planet, but tends to affect impoverished people at a disproportionate rate ( These phones are being made by people in foreign countries for minimal wages, and poor families who save up money to buy a new phone lose a large portion of their purchase's value within the next year.) . I think your iPhone example is the perfect way to highlight how out of hand this problem has gotten. Not only because it highlights the effects planned obsolescence has on the values of consumers phones, but also showcases how widespread this can get. Everyone and their mother has an iPhone these days, and despite being aware of planned obsolescence (iPhone 6 Controversy) continue to line up on launch day to buy their fancy new device. 
    <br><br>

I also found it interesting how the effects of post WWII America are still being felt today, and one could argue that the United States continues to go to war because the surge in economic growth during and afterwards has become addictive. I've commonly heard the criticism that the United States occupancy and military presence in the Middle East is for the sole purpose of keeping our oil prices cheap. But never have I heard anyone associate our country's desire for cheap oil with our country's obsession with cars and and large homes. When looking at current events with the perspective given to us by "The Waste Makers", one can't help but realize that all of this is indeed our fault.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you on that planned obsolescence of desirability is very apparent in today’s society. iPhones are a perfect example of this. I don’t understand why people are so eager to upgrade their iPhones every year. Their “innovative” ideas are becoming less innovative. If you ask anyone what the major differences are between an iPhone 10 and iPhone 11 is, they would find that hard to answer. I feel as if with every new iPhone, Apple’s main selling point with every new iPhone is that it has a bigger screen, and more cameras. Despite this though, there are many people who jump to buy the new iPhone each year.  
    <br><br>

I also found it interesting the effects WWII had on the market and consumerism. I found it intriguing how the president encouraged the public to buy as much as  you can for the sake of the economy.  It’s no wonder why today’s society is so materialistic when we’ve been conditioned to buying things we don’t need since the 50’s. I can relate to you in that ever since Amazon Prime became a thing, my family buys so many unnecessary things. I think in the past 6 months, my family has placed over 80 orders, which is insane.  We buy things just to buy it. It doesn’t help the fact that Amazon is so convenient with its’ reliable two day shipping for prime members. I agree with your statement saying that society has been manipulated by corporations into becoming material hungry consumers.

<br><hr>

The iPhone was the first thing that came to mind when I read “The Waste Makers” as well. It perfectly fits the idea of planned obsolescence of desirability. Every small update causes the previous model to go completely out of style in the minds of consumers, even though it still functions just as well. Additionally, Apple has been accused of planned obsolescence of quality too (software updates that drain the battery life of older models). Interestingly, the company has been so good at marketing their products to consumers, that even after this news was leaked people still continued to buy every update just to “stay in style”.



Apple, and so many corporations like it, have been very strategic in the way that they have created consumers. It was shocking to read how the general public is manipulated in order to make these companies profit. Not only do they sell products, they sell ideas about what the ideal life is, and in turn shape the way that society looks at success. It is crazy to think that our lifestyles, which I always assumed were based on a natural evolution of society, were actually crafted as a marketing plan.
<br><hr>
I really appreciated the iPhone example in Mazur's "The Waste Makers" too. I thought that the demand for companies to produce new items and even going as far as sabotaging them so that future versions will be more successful was absolutely disgusting. In addition, more than anything that bothers me about the iPhone is the fact that the second one comes out, your older version is deemed undesirable and almost embarrassing to keep around. Apple has a way of marketing that creates a negative aura around past products, which surprises me because I figured that old products would be just as well publicized and supported. I agree with Aniket's answer to Ken's question though. I think that the problem with consumerism lies within the brands who promote this mentality of wanting everything. I think it would be so much better for the environment if we all took the time to truly research and invest in products that will last us a lifetime. I think that after this week of content, I've already become more of a cautious shopper too, and I think that educating the people around us is the best way to push the message further.

After reading the article "The Waste Maker", the part that struck me out is the making "new" products for profit. From the perspective of consumers, it seems like those companies only care about the money, so they publish the new products frequently, especially, when the new products only with little improvement. And, with the social trend of chasing the latest fashion, some people think those companies force them to purchase the latest products to earn their money. This is weird for me since I am not the person who always wants to catch the fashion. From the perspective of companies, publishing the new product annually or seasonally is necessary. In today's competitive market, without a new product means you are behind others. In addition, there are a lot of official exhibitions for every company to reveal the new product at the same time, such as the CES. 
    <br><br>
Therefore, I think publishing a new product is both accelerating technology and providing more options for the consumer to choose the appropriate one. And, consumers are the key to decide whether it is a waste or not. As long as consumers can get rid of the mind of catching the fashion and purchase rationally, the waste will reduce. Besides, once consumers control themselves, it will reflect on the market demand which sends a message to the corporation that people don't need it that much. Considering the profit, the supply of products from the corporation will also reduce, making the waste less.

Vance Packard's "The Waste Makers" changed my perspective on consumerism. I never knew the true dangers of it and how it can negatively affect both the environment and economy. Growing up, I always believed that the more we bought, the more other businesses thrived, helping the stock markets and keeping the economy in a good place. This is not how it works however, as production of goods increases despite how much we are buying as consumers. It surprised me when hearing that the economy would take a hit if we don't increase our already excessive consumption, and that all of the past U.S. recessions were caused by the failure of businesses to gear their production down to what clearly can be consumed. Companies continuously feel the need to create more products, and more variations of the products already produced to attract customers that fall for new packaging concepts and smaller improvements, which is a great majority of Americans including myself. This has caused output to increase every year by 3%, an astonishingly high amount considering that's just what's happening in one year. When compared to other countries, Russia for example, the U.S. continues to outproduce them by at least 20:1. The tactics that were mentioned in the reading were angering because the sad thing is most people fall for the advertising. The examples used such as needing more carpets to make one's house feel more like a home, or that women need different colored stocking to match their outfits are some of the stupid reasons for buying more things, but goes to show how people care so much about public opinion that they will continue to buy and throw away over and over again. This has shown me that there such thing as an overdeveloped country, and that physical possessions seem to be the biggest priority to most people.

After reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I find something really interesting that some of the products have been designed to be thrown away. For example, like the author writes in the articles” millions of 'used' tubes of lipstick are thrown away with a half inch of lipstick remaining in the tube because the mechanism will not bring up all the lipstick". there are also other examples like the chocolate sauce and tooth paste. There is always some of them remaining to be thrown away. From my own perspective, what we should do is to control the waste from the producer. We should ask the producer to use suitable packaging in order to waste less.

"The Waste Makers" is a book about consumerism as a production of waste. The author highlights how businesses and  manufacturers persuade us as consumers to buy items that can be considered as extra in our lives. The book also underlines the concept of planned obsolesce, where consumer goods become obsolete and needs to be replaced. People are brainwashed from fast fashion and this concept explains about how consumers into a mindless loophole of consumerism. This theory was brought up in 1960, yet planned obsolesce still very much exists today. One example is our smartphones. Smartphones need replacing every couple of years as the battery life and software cannot keep up. Yet its solution is buying a new smartphone, released every year that is supposedly "the best ever".

Reading Packard’s “The Waste Makers,” I’m once again made aware of the destructive path of rabid consumerism that America has taken. It’s disappointing to see how the value of individual possessions have changed over the years. As the reading mentions, Americans used to treasure their possessions with greater value. With this mentality, generations of the past lived their everyday lives consuming less while valuing and cherishing the limited amount they do consume. With the shift towards mass consumerism, it’s shocking to see the immediate effects it has had towards society, let alone delayed impacts on the environment. People today are buying more while becoming less satisfied with the goods that they have. Since the needs of humans have basically remained the same for thousands of years, such excess of goods become wastes. When considering how much the daily life and routine has changed over the years, it’s nearly incomprehensible how much waste is created over one’s lifetime. With spending and wasting becoming embedded into our daily routine and habits, the effects overtime is devastating.

Hi there Ken. Thank you again for providing an eye-opening reading for this week. After reading “Waste Makers” I couldn’t help but feel shame, guilt, and anger at myself and companies for making this (the climate crisis and constant creation of waste) happen. To answer your question of who I believe is responsible for our obsession with consumerism, I believe it the fault lies on companies that have advertised and fed the population this propaganda. Although I do believe the majority of the blame is on major corporations, we the consumers play a role in how what happens next. We are the population that the manipulating corporations make so much money off of and help continue the cycle of production, and we have the power to stop it. 
    <br><br>

Prior to reading “Waste Makers” and watching this weeks and last week's films, I would argue that my spending and relationship to things was unchecked. I saw things as disposable and if something wore out, I could easily “just buy a new one.” After checking my actions and relationship to things, I feel that I am almost obligated to help people see the same. For instance, after watching “Minimalism” and “The True Cost” sent my mom a picture of the movie and asked her to watch it. She is currently watching it right now and I plan to talk to her about what she thought and things I have learned in this class.

After reading the Waste Maker, I know why I have powerlessness when I try to do something different to change the Earth. I decided not to eat beef, but I knew many people will, and the beef company will continue to produce the massive amount of beef products for the consumers. And I can’t stop it. My power is so small that I can't go against a company. Companies will always overproduce items for consumers. They prefer to have something left rather than “out of stock”. 
    <br><br>
	Meanwhile, people also like to have “improvement”. Just this summer, my mom bought a new apartment, and we have to buy the electrical equipment and furniture. Step into the mall, there are thousands of types of furniture. What’s the differences? Well, they are both tables, one is a smart home, one is not. However, we just need a table. I don’t believe this improvement of smart homes is necessary. But most of the time, our consumers are obsessed with this kind of advertising. Because of our obsession, the companies are continuing to have those unnecessary improvements.

When I first started thinking about what to major in college, marketing was always up there in terms of what seemed the most interesting. I ended up picking economics as my major but always thought about what would've happened had I chosen a marketing major. However, after reading "The Wastemakers" I realized that being a marketing major would've been such a poor decision. From all that I have gathered, marketing schemes are the root cause of rampant consumerism. Ultimately, as pointed out in The Wastemakers, it is how a product is sold rather than selling the product. Now to elaborate on my previous point, when you look around at consumerism trends, it is primarily centered around the "hype" of each product. Whether it be an insanely overpriced white t-shirt with a box logo of Supreme or a Juul which has caused severe lung and breathing problems, quite frankly it doesn't really matter the constituents of the products but rather having the product is what matters. The way "hype" is derived is quite simply through the essence of marketing. Marketing campaigns broadcasted through different forms of media make these hazardous products seem so appealing. Once, these products gain attraction they blow up bullishly on such a large scale. However, we then see another product being marketed which then gains the same bullish attraction and now people are no longer interested in the previous product. It's a vicious cycle to the environment. Gigafactories being fueled by mass consumerism, only for the environment to be polluted more. A sad reality.

After reading The Waste Maker, it showed me how the company is marketing. I never really considered overproduction of goods on the market. These companies claim that the improvements made are indeed subtle and honest, and they just take up more space on the planet. 
    <br><br>
Every year people look forward to what Apple releases this year. Every year Apple says it's the best iPhone ever. However, the difference between them is not large, even small. They seduce consumers to buy their goods. They don't care about providing quality products. They don't care about wasting products. They only care about making money. Lessening the lifespan allows for faster production of products, cheaper production of products, and more consumption of products.

The three most frequent words that kindergarten children say are more, mine and no. People naturally want more things, they have the concept of property rights, and they also have the idea of pursuing freedom. These are all innate abilities. But the three most frequent words that kindergarten teachers say are wait, line up and share. Wait: be patient and look long-term; line up: be orderly; share: find more happiness. We are born to want more things, but if we are educated to see the long-term, we must also share this planet with creatures around the world. Sharing and watching in the long run is difficult to achieve, but it is also what we must strive to achieve.

This piece of reading had left me pondering about the relationship I have with the products I purchased, my purchasing habits, and our overall how the whole society of consumers are influenced by big companies’ intricate marketing strategies. These strategies listed and explained in the chapters are definitely informative and really explains why we would have these toxic patterns of consuming patterns nowadays. When we think about it, we have to appraise how genius and cleverly designed they are that it is hard for us to see what these big companies want to shape us to be. 
    <br><br>

One example of rapid consumerism can be found in clothing industries. I remembered last week either in the lecture or film that I learned that fashion industries purposefully change up the “current trend” at a frequent fashion (no puns intended) in order to let more people purchase their clothings more frequently. In order to do so too, they even cut out the clothes that they ruled “obsolete” so that they would not be picked up again. This absurd way for making money is not only unhealthy towards our bank accounts, our judgement of “fashion” and most importantly, the environment. Imagine all the materials needed to be supplied which leads to more unnecessary consumption towards valuable resources, the factories cranking up production lines everyday to meet the demands, and how much CO2 do that produce? 
    <br><br>

Recently I finished a show called the Good Place which I absolutely love. In one of the scenes, the afterlife judge mentions that what determines if we go to the Good Place or the Bad Place is the choices we make and the consequences impacted by that choice --- for example, if we just randomly purchase a cloth off discount, all the environmental impacts, including pollution emitted by producing this one cloth and animal killed are all accounted in it. And since everyone isn't really aware of these impacts, and a lot of the products and choices people purchase and make have tremendous amounts of “collateral damages”, nobody had been going to the Good Place for 500 something years. Although it is a rigge process for judging if a person is good or not, but I believe it is a good system to measure our carbon footprints and what we have done indirectly to the environment, and it definitely make us think twice when we are going to make con-environment decisions.

I agree with you completely in that this reading made me immensely more aware of the particular buying and fashion choices I have made in the past. It is quite shocking to read about how fashion industries are purposely trying to goad people into consuming more without a thought to those who cannot afford to use savings simply for the benefit of the higher-ups of the fashion industries. 
    <br><br>

One quote that stuck with me particularly was one of the slogans that stated "Buy now-the job you save may be your own." It is quite horrible that this slogan that’s meant to make people want to buy more is in truth more of a threat to people who refuse to buy into the thousands and thousands of advertisements that are being pushed onto them. When stripped of how pretty this saying says, what it’s really trying to say is “if you don’t buy more and more of our products continuously, you will be out of a job because we can make that happen. Our society has officially become so enamored with this “fast fashion” as you pointed out, that we no longer look into what we’re constantly being fed.

Packard's "The Waste Makers" was a really informative and eye opening read. Prior to reading chapters 2-7, I had already knew about planned obsolescence, and I knew companies made things that would break down just to make more money. What I didn't know, was the degree to which these companies have been doing this and how bad its been. I also didn't know that American companies have been doing this since the 60's and earlier. 

    <br><br>

I think "The Waste Makers" is a really good read because it shows the monetary value of minimalism. Consumerism is all about buying more, bigger, and better. The problem with this is the waste it creates and the environmental toll. On top of this, consumerism hurts the consumer. In the end, you will end up wasting money and wasting resources. 

    <br><br>

The fact that companies know very well what they are doing and still choose to push consumerism agenda is not surprising. People have always put money above morals. From my perspective, the least I can do is support companies who value quality over quantity. Its a win-win. I will get more quality items, thus saving money, and the company gets good business and protects the environment. I actually enjoyed this book because as an econ major, I found it to be very interesting. It didn't just lay out the morals. It proved why consumerism is not a good trade off for the consumer. It showed why we as Americans make the decisions we make (buy big, buy more).

After reading this article I was shocked at the range of effects that consumerism has had on the United States after the Great Depression. After the collapse of the economy, industries, politicians and almost the entire American public became obsessed with the idea of promoting economic growth through excessive consumption. And in an attempt to jumpstart the economy, firms began producing more than could ever be actually consumed by buyers, and therefore turned to manipulation, through the creating the narrative of obsolescence of desire. The public has been conditioned to believe that consumerism and capitalism are central to a successful economy, and while that may be true in moderation, the level at which American’s are currently consuming is not only unsustainable for the environment, but personally damaging to the individual. 

    <br><br>

I found the notion of “planned obsolescence of desirability” to be the most interesting and shocking aspect of the book. I have always taken pride in my own sense of “style” and fashion. Learning that these concepts have been essentially fabricated is insane. The fashion industry creates the idea of style to manipulate the public into thinking that one can never own enough clothing, and that wearing what is in style should be of the utmost importance to every individual. What’s even more shocking is the extent to which this idea has escalated in recent years as the fast fashion industry is taking over. After reading this, I am going to challenge myself to question my urges when wanting to make a purchase.

This week’s reading further deepened my understanding on the points that Thoreu made on last week’s reading. In Chapter 4: There’s Always For More, it was incited that our society aims to perpetually provide consumers with plausible excuses for buying more of each product than what might seem rational in preceding years. One example given was about how we market the diverse interactions with a product: one swimsuit for the morning sun, one for the noonday sun, one for the evening sun. The capitalist society, that Thoreu contradicts, will do anything it’s power to preserve a consumer minded culture. In Chapter 7: Planned Obsolescence and Desirability, I was realized by guilt because I myself partake in the excessiveness of design changes in clothing. This reading is definitely enlightening, I realized that the public is convinced  that style is an important element of consumption and that makes it very target.

It’s really tricky for those companies to upgrade their products by improving their attractiveness to consumers instead of their qualities and functions. This is the strategy that companies use to maximize their sales and profits and it’s nearly impossible to change their views of profit. Consequently, I think it’s really important for us to establish a reasonable concept of consuming of “what we need instead of what we can afford”. I used to buy things almost every time when I stepped into a store, because I think it made me happy and I will definitely use it one day. But, later, I found out that the more stuff I buy the more I need to get rid of, and, in fact, many new stuff that I never use go into the trash eventually. As I realize what it is wrong, I’m buying less, but what I buy always reflects it value. As a result, I think my new consuming ideology help me save space and contribute less to greenhouse gas emission caused by manufacturing.

Reading "The Waste Makers" was extremely informative, and reminds me of Minimalism and Walden. For people at our age nowadays, we actually have everything, we have many clothes to wear, we have places to live and we have foods to eat. And all of the above are actually what we need to live on this Earth. However, the truth is people can’t fulfill with their desires, which is quite frightening. Since we are surrounded by advertisements, cosmetics, shoes and clothes, when people see beautiful things, they want to have it, this is human nature. Everybody want to own beautiful things and we also want to live the glamorous or relaxing lives, so we buy new things following or imitate celebrities, since we wish to live better, or maybe to live a life similar with theirs. For me, I commit that I am now at a age of getting fulfillment from buying stuffs, living the life of buying one or two new clothes or cosmetics every week, which aims to make me feel happy or a kind of relax after a tough week of studying and working. It is a strange feeling, since buying stuffs is like a kind of completing a goal every week, maybe that is the true meaning of empty stage in my life. So, the most important solutions of this issue is to control our desires and try live a simple life, maybe set goals of buying less or saving money to do other more meaningful things maybe helpful.

Before reading this article and video, I have seen many videos and short articles about the impact of human activities on the environment, but my doubts have not been answered. I can't help thinking about the fact that people always refuse or don't admit that they have a huge negative impact on the environment, why someone is always trying to persuade others that we are not polluting the environment, why not most people are committed to protecting the environment, why the shopping malls don't strongly recommend environmentally-friendly clothes of higher quality, why the hot sellers are always Those clothes that are so-called trendy but of low quality are easy to break. But every time I get confused, I don't think of the fact that such a consumption mode can help our economic development. Although I have learned before that the current economic system needs high-speed consumption to maintain a balance, I have never combined these two points. People are so keen to buy the fashionable clothes with low quality in the store, which is exactly what the current economic system needs. The high-speed and high-speed consumption, when a very short tide passes, a large number of clothes will be thrown away and wasted as garbage, which is just suitable for the economic system. However, what shocked me most was that I always thought that we Chinese people were the most enthusiastic people in the world in shopping and fashion pursuit. I didn't expect that the Americans were so enthusiastic about this, which also made me understand that environmental protection is far from as simple as I thought.

After reading "The Waste Makers" it is very clear we have a problem with consumerism in the United States. Many people find a release in spending money purchasing useless clothing adding to their global footprint. The production and transport of clothing release CO2;  this has been excused due to the argument that clothing industries are necessary for areas of low wealth where many people do not have other options to make money. 

    <br><br>

I believe another blame for this consumerism problem is the presence of online shopping. At any time of day or night with the help of a phone and internet access, you can purchase almost anything. If you are bored; you online shop, if you are hungry; you get food delivered via one of many food delivery companies. Both of these choices have some form of CO2 emissions compared to the counterparts of minimalism and making your own vegetable-based food at home.

What I find most interesting about this week’s reading is that it was written decades ago but is becoming increasingly relevant today. Similar to Thoreau’s Walden, this is another example of someone being ahead of their time. The fact that Packard was able to see the issues with the growing consumerism in America in the 1950s just shows that the writing was on the wall for these issues. These problems aren’t new, they have been around for many years and will continue to become more prominent as time passes. 
    <br><br>
Just as the economy was growing during Packard’s time, today’s economy has grown exponentially. The continued emphasis on this consumerist culture of America emphasizes the importance of change. Just as Packard condemns the production methods of companies in his time, we must also condemn these methods today.
    <br><br>
I actually wonder what Packard would think of seeing American society today. When he describes the massive amounts of cars being produced in his time, it was likely unimaginable for him to conceive the number of cars being produced today. His arguments against consumerism and capitalism may have been revolutionary for his time but have become commonplace in today’s society.

I like the point that you make about how books written decades ago are now increasing more relevant to our time. It's sort of like the authors knew this would happen all along and they were trying to warn societies before the issues became all too apparent. I wonder what these authors would have thought about the state of our economy and environment that we live in today- would it be what they imagined? Would it be worse?

After reading "The Waste Makers," it truly shocked me hearing about how corrupt corporations are. Though I know America’s need to buy things is great, a lot of the times this consumption is a result of these tricks used by companies. At the cash register of a store, you’d really never think of the things a company does purposely to get consumers to keep buying things-- but I guess that’s why they do it. It really feels helpless as a consumer, for these companies have such dominance over our lives. It’s important for us to be informed about how companies tamper with our behaviors and desires, and to inform other people about what we know. I remember watching YouTube “conspiracy theory” videos that would talk about different ways companies may try to influence consumers. For example, at Disneyland, they supposedly have sweet-smelling vents throughout the park to influence visitors to purchase the overpriced food they sell. We also see other cases like celebrities being used in commercials to influence a greater amount of people. These tactics are always being played out when we don’t realize it. These companies care more about money than lives, and that's the scary part. Companies feel fine with promoting damaged or harmful products, and with creating monstrous consumer habits with their buyers. Greed is invisible, but when we are careful about what and how much we waste, we may be able to be the help instead of helpless.

The question that really interests me from "The Waste Makers" is whether the producer or the consumer creates the demand that leads to the excess of modern consumerism. The narrative in the reading seems to say that the producers create this demand, as they produce to such an extent that they need to justify this continual growth with continual consumption to match. As Packard notes, "A true salesman rejects the concept that a market can ever be satiated". At the same time, justifying this sort of production can be difficult, since you can only improve many basic home appliances and furniture so much. The waffle-maker has been perfected, sad to say. But perhaps the consumer truly wants a new, innovative waffle-maker. This arises from the argument that the consumers alone create the demand of modern consumerism (though perhaps not with such an absurd example). I don't believe that the consumer demand can arise from nothing though, it must first start with the producer creating the demand through advertising or other means. How can a consumer demand something they don't know exists yet? Once the consumer has the new product, demand can be furthered one of two ways: competing producers or different brands under the same producer. The different brands under the same producer especially contributes to the excess that we see today, when we can select from 20 different kinds of peanut butter at the store (not to mention almond, cashew, sunflower, etc). From here, consumers gradually become accustomed to this abundance and begin to expect continual progress/growth in every market. 
    <br><br>


Consumers can certainly create their own sense of obsolescence of function, quality, and desirability. A company did not have to tell a person whose sock torn that they should demand stronger socks. However, the producers can accelerate or make this process artificial. This is where planned obsolescence comes in: when a product is made cheaply with the sole purpose of the consumer replacing it more often than required, then capitalism succeeds in it's goal of creating additional profit, in generating wealth for wealth's sake. However, the amount of waste created in the process with these sorts of practices is what has come to kill the planet as we already know. This is not to say that all advertising should be banned: as I mentioned, producers create that initial spark for a product's demand. Instead, if we culturally shifted away from being accustomed to a constant influx of advertising (thanks to Google AdSense) and from the idea that never-ending growth=progress, then consumerism might be fought. In this way, 'extreme' lifestyles like minimalism (the opposite of what we have now), are helpful when people begin to consider the upsides of something even approaching that kind of lifestyle.

After watching the documentary about minimalism last week I had been reflecting on consumerism and the waste we create as a society. I found that topic really interesting so reading this book was eye opening and genuinely interesting to read. Packard really encompassed the origins of American consumerism and how it has developed. Considering that this book was written in 1960, it is still so relevant to our modern day economy. What caught my attention is his statement that the US falls into a “failure to grow” recession when the government and consumers fail to increase their spending by 4% every year because our economy runs on a structure of increased expenditure. Our economy is under the impression of unlimited funds since technology and capitalism has allowed for such high means of productivity and there is simply not the demand to match it. That’s seen in the grain surplus in our economy since the US government subsidizes farmers to grow crops that aren’t needed. Our economy is in a surplus and has been since the 50s when consumerism was on the rise, all as a product of US government policies and corporate interests. I find it incredibly interesting to find the roots of issues that have become ingrained in our ways of life and are the norm. America’s desire and need to buy things are a product of marketing skills to create a “need” thought process in our heads and in part by playing on the idea that purchasing will help the economy. While spending does increase growth in the economy, the oversimplification of President Eisenhower’s solution to the recession by telling the population to simply buy turned into a marketing strategy for companies. It was also interesting to learn about the development of the norm of having multiple of items (appliances, cars, cosmetics) since it is a practice that is now taken for granted and normalized. The hegemonic idea of consumerism and our desire for new and more has all been socially constructed and it needs to be changed. I recognized myself in many of the examples he set forth and it has truly made me reevaluate how shallow some of my purchases are and how much I feed into the consumerism cycle. While I do not think I am as far gone as some people, I know that I need to change and I truly am much more conscious of what I buy and its true utility.

After reading chapters 2 to chapter 7 of the book Waste Makers, I feel that we are solely to blame for the wastage and pollution that we experience every day. People have developed a habit of buying more commodities than they need. The author says that people consume twice the volume of commodities presently as compared to the years prior to World War II (Packard, 1960). I think many key players that include the government and marketers have influenced this trend through intensive advertisements and slogans to influence the masses (Packard, 1960). 
    <br><br>

 The main root of the crisis is the competition that exists between the nations. The fight for markets among marketers is also to blame. Marketers have always been on a mission to maintain high volume sales. By doing this, they formulate compulsive measures to make the population impulsive buyers of commodities. The production of surplus commodities than which the market demands leads to wastefulness. I feel that the government and the marketers should have come up with better ways to mitigate the economic recessions as opposed to encouraging people to spend what they do not require. Wastage would be averted.

Within the book, “The Waste Makers” when it talked about the American Consumerisms culture, it was shocking to me that before, they truly found value and kept their possessions at high standards, but nowadays its shifted towards having more stuff and constantly buying and having more stuff. Americans today easily go through items and stuff much more quickly than before and it demonstrates that more people are unsatisfied with what they have nowadays, so people tend to just keep on buying and buying. The culture of consumerism is negatively affecting our environment and will continue to damage the world if the rate of our consuming ways does not change. One of the things that definitely caught my attention, and what Ken also talked about, was the fact that companies purposely sabotage the items that people would buy so that in a couple years they would have to buy things again. The fact this way of lifestyle has persisted for so long has left a damaging impact in our environment and it is something that has to definitely be changed now.

In his bestselling book, “The Waste Makers,” Vance Packard highlights some of the devious techniques of big businesses in the world of consumerism we live in. While consumerism is often seen as a large issue in our society, people tend to focus on the problems regarding the consumers, rather than those of businesses that are ultimately profiting from the vulnerability of consumers. Through perfectly curated advertisements, companies are making people believe that they need some product or item, when in reality, this necessity doesn’t even exist. Planned obsolescence is an extremely useful tactic utilized by companies all the time, helping them gain seemingly indefinite interest of the consumer population. For example, Apple comes out with a new version of the iPhone every year, and because of both advertisement and planned obsolescence, everyone seems to “need” this new phone because their current phone is either glitching or “not good enough” anymore. This cycle seems like it will never end; businesses will always want to make more money and consumers will be locked into this trap of “needing” only the best and greatest version of anything they may previously own.
    <br><br>

One of Packard’s ideas that stood out to me the most was the “two-or-more-of-a-kind concept.” While reading that section of the book, I realized how normalized that is for me (as well as much of the Western world). Scarily enough, having more than one of a given object is something that I rarely think twice about, as it has been ingrained in society for so long that this is normal. After reading about the increase in “necessity” of having multiple of the same product, I realized how crazy it really is; one should be enough, but because of the world we live in today, we’re accustomed to think otherwise.

I found "The Makers of Waste" interesting as it focused on consumerism. I found it quite embarrassing for our country that foreigners comment on our abundance. We take for granted our needs and give into the consumer culture. As mentioned, some people have a television set which may be substituting for adequate food in their budget. We are selfish in the ways that there are many who are “ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed”; we consume what is non-essential to our well-being. It is sad to say that we are now producing more than what we consume and that is a major problem. Many production companies also use smart selling strategies. I found the example of woman buying different colored stockings to match their outfit interesting. I find these strategies quite intriguing, in the way that they easily induce the consumers to step up their consumption. Throughout these strategies they also encourage to get rid of the old and buy the new. I think a good example of the know statement ‘out with the old and in with the new’ is the advertisement and production of Apple products. Our economy has been driven by our consumptions and sadly we are targeted by the use of strategical techniques. They work on making products obsolete by designing them to wear out and limit their use. It is all planned, and many industries apply this technique by determining what is out of style and not modern; they destroy the value of our possessions. Once again, we Americans have a large consumer culture and even being aware of our bad consumption habits it is difficult for most of us to steer away.

After reading "Making Waste," I learned that companies use this certain strategy to target the audience and to convince the consumers that the item that they are buying are completely necessary. However, if one actually pays attention to the details, the products that we as consumers buy is completely unnecessary sometimes. In the book, the author mentions that the engineering departments of corporate companies doesn't really invent completely new items. Instead, they constantly improve those certain items from the previous generations while keeping the main function in tact. The improvements may seem very amazing but in reality they aren't the most impactful contributions to the item's main function. After learning this information, I felt as if we (the consumers) are being manipulated by the companies about these products. The companies persuade us in so many different ways in regards to our necessity toward these products. And not only the companies manipulate us, we manipulate ourselves too. We convince ourselves that we need the newly improved items because we want to show others in society what we have and flaunt our possessions. This pattern of consumption will eventually put even more burden not only on. our society but also on our environment because we are constantly wasting products away when we don't need to. Therefore, I believe that people, including myself, should be more mindful on what we consume and purchase every day because we purchase items more than what we need to live, it is extremely damaging to our lives and our planet.

While reading “The Waste Makers” I was surprised to hear that buying was actually pushed from a political standpoint. I understand that buying/producing can boost the economy, but at what cost. Companies are so eager to get their products out there that they are continually creating “new” products although it isn’t much different from the last four. The products we already own began to look old to us as new modernized ones come out, so we feel degraded and judged. I know that as the new iPhones come out, many people automatically go in and buy the new thousand-dollar phone. Even those who bought the new phone the year before. I own an iPhone 6s that is a couple of years old, although the camera might not be the best, it still serves the purpose of a phone. Although, if I had the money I would definitely upgrade to the new iPhone. This is the problem, if we think we have the money for it, we will buy the newest but not improved versions of any item.
    <br><br>

In this reading, when they began talking about automobiles, I was surprised to hear that not many of the cars differ from year to year. Yeah, I know some now have touch screen radios and automatic parking, but at that point, why do we even need a license. Consumerism has completely shifted from buying our necessities such as clothing and shelter to buying all these luxury items such as expensive cars and six hundred dollar handbags. This reminds me of “True Cost” when it was stated that they now have 56 seasons instead of four. This is a perfect example of producing items that not only serve the same purpose as the ones before, but they look more modern and up to date. Consumerism has become such a huge part of our culture that many think that America will die off if we attempt to decrease it. We have been brainwashed from many years ago, as seen in this reading, and this will be extremely difficult to reverse. Although, it is very possible and it is something that should be prioritized.

It's so true. Our culture focuses on the word "economy". We're always working towards improving the economy, but why when absolutely everything else comes crumbling down alongside it. What's the point in the end if we have nothing left to even live off of, then the term "economy" will hold no weight whatsoever. Consumerism is quite frankly a disease that plagues us. There is a cure, but it's so difficult to get everyone the vaccine when so many people deny they have a problem, even when the prognosis is staring them in the face.

In Vance Packard’s classic 1960 study of consumerism, “The Waste Makers”, the text exposes “the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals” and explores how the rapid growth of consumer goods was negatively influencing the environment and the American society. Packard mentions the ways producers and advertisers persuade consumers to buy things that they actually don’t need and brings attention to the concept of planned obsolescence and the throwaway spirit. Products are given a “death date” when they are created so that they wear out quickly and need consumers to buy again in order to replace them. This infinite loop is making people more wasteful and carefree in their consuming habits and is greatly using up our natural resources.
    <br><br>

I felt upset to learn all these schemes and greed behind commerce. For the sake of money, producers even do not hesitate to destroy the trust between people and rather choose to against the moral. How sad! If the greedy heart of the producer is hard to change, then we must examine and introspect our own consuming habits since only improper thoughts would lead to problematic actions. Have we fallen into producers’ trap? Do we really need those products or it’s just a whim? If the decisions are made under reasons, we would be able to minimize the success of these schemes.

While reading "Waste Makers", I found that I never really thought about how big of a problem consumerism is. I will say that I am the type of person that loves to keep up with trendy clothes, so I often find myself online shopping. Usually, I find myself shopping just to fit in, and not necessarily out of need, which is something that I really need to work on. I definitely think we are victims of manipulation at the hands of companies through their advertisements, but I also think we as consumers need to do more to be more conscious about where we get our clothes. If we all stopped supporting companies that profit off destroying pour planet, they would literally go out of business. When you think about it, they need us more than we need them because we can always go to thrift shops or those type of things to get clothes, but they need our money to keep running.

The book " The date makers" as well as Ken's video provided me with a new perspective of the event of last ceuntry's American overproduction of some goods, and it also related me with another similar event happened in last country in China  called great leap forward. The lucky thing I recognized that the overproduction was not only because of the profits corporate wanted to earn, but also because of the economic situations and addressing issues such as unemployment. I could partly understand that under the pressure from other great countries in 20th century,  the US needed to develop its economics in order to steads its position in the world. It must also address the problems such as several economic recessions in 20th century. However, this could make the environment worse because of the useless items they produced, but it really worked. Compared with China at the same time period, it had a very interesting thought, and it summoned all the people together to use all its metals--whether they are suitable or not, to try to produce steel. At last, not only it failed at last, polluted the environment, but also wasted lots of materials, and make the whole economy feel back for several decades. the thing I want to say was maybe every country need to find their way during their own development, this could be filled with pollution; There are also bad incorporators who could see nothing but their own profits, but we need to tell ourselves that there are more good people there, so they will not intentionally do the bad things. for US, We just need to inform people what is right to do since we have already stood on the top of the world. It is time for us to do something good to return this world.

The economy relies heavily on the supply of consumer goods; this economic structure of supply and demand has been redefined as explained in the reading. After World War II, the U.S became an industrially heavy-based economy therefore in order to maintain the exponential trend they had to then manufacture weapons, they switched to new businesses that relied on factors. The switch from foreign affairs to domestic affairs radically changed society into its modern form focused on materialism. 
    <br><br>
Manufacturing businesses began to saturate society with advertisements meant to create an image of modern women, men, and family. For example, a business scheme implemented in the 1900s were the more-sales-through-matching. This tactic was meant to influence both women and men that in order to look well and put-together they must have color matching items, thus promoting the sales of the same item yet in different colors. People were fooled into believing that they had to look a certain way in order to be fit into society thus people began to depend on materials to have self-identification. Thus business companies expanded from this though into greater and more expensive purchases such as homes and furniture. The two house family became the new model every family had to follow in order to comply with the new living standards society imposed. The two house family consisted of more stuff in larger homes, meaning that the new (aka modern) standard was to have two washers and two dryers, two to three cars, two or if not a massive refrigerator and in order to fit all these new appliances well families had to move to larger homes. Basically, everything in the U.S becomes about more and more. 
    <br><br>
The constant supply of consumer goods has led to a decrease of purchases due to the fact that consumers no longer see the relevance in buying more of the same things; however, it continues to affect our society in large ways. Global companies such as Apple, for instance, have structured their business in three categories: make a “new” model of the “old”, sell replacement pieces, and sell to other family members. The reason for Apple’s massive success after so many years has to be linked with their ability to persuade their customers into buying their latest and recently improved technology. Plus they also benefit if the consumer damages the product because then the consumer brings the damaged product back to the store so it can be fixed and they have no additional cost as they already purchased AppleCare when buying the product. 
    <br><br>
Overall, our business companies are manipulating our lives into believing that we need stuff that in reality does not fulfill any necessity.

“Today, the average citizen of the United States is consuming twice as much in the way of goods as the average citizen consumed in the years just before World War II.” This is not a surprising fact to me. Our consumption is increasing at an exponential rate and our effort to stop it will take severe action. In Packard’s book “The Waste Makers”, he dives into the consumer culture we have developed and how companies are influencing people to consume more and save less. Out of the three types of planned obsolescence: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability, obsolescence of quality is the most alarming to me. They’re ploys give the consumer no choice but to keep needing new items because the ones they buy don't last properly. Planned obsolescence of quality forces the consumer to rely on the companies to keep providing the product because they fail to keep up the quality of the item. You would think this tactic is so transparent, however, the consumer culture of today rewards excessive purchases and glorifies quantity over quality. Where obsolescence of function and desirability prompts the consumer with an option, obsolescence of quality forces the consumer to have to continue they’re consumption. 
    <br><br>

I think the true blame for the excessive consumerism we see today is on the companies glamorizing it. I think people just want to fit in, and live a happy life according to society's standards. These companies are advertising the fantasy of consumption around every corner, so it's impossible for society to not follow their false narratives. Although I place blame on the companies advertising and glamorizing excessive consumption, I believe it's the consumer who has the power to stop these companies, and it’s their responsibility to stop them. The companies will supply if there's a demand.

After reading Vance Packer's, "Waste Makers", I was somewhat saddened that I've found myself consumed in many of the things talked about. I'm all for fast fashion; cutting buying clothes out of my life will most definitely reduce my carbon footprint drastically. Even though it's becoming clear ramped consumerism is bad for our environment, I always wonder at what point will people actually stop consuming and make big lifestyle changes to better our environment. When people actually start making change, how much further will we be along in our path to "world destruction". I also find it pretty despicable that tobacco companies have been feeding off the health and well-being of children just for the sake of profit. It seems many people in power aren't putting any emphasis on taking environmentally friendly, heck even moral, actions. I don't think it's the consumer's fault for the mass consumerism going on today. Fast fashion was designed to increase people's consumerism. Utilizing FOMO (fear of missing out), companies can get their customers to buy all of their latest clothing trends they deem fashionable. It's scary how these corporations can manipulate our behavior without us realizing it so easily.

After reading "The Waste Makers", I got a better perspective about the growing consumerism that has become a defining part of our culture. Just by looking at my desk, I see many items that are not necessities. Furthermore, as a young adult, many of the items I own aren't necessities, but rather novelty items that I just bought for myself. It is sad to think about how much materialism has become tied up with a person's social status. Rather than judging a person based on their actions, a person's first impression can be hugely based on their appearance or the clothes they are wearing. The irony of it is that often time, the quality of clothing or items doesn't matter- as long as it looks trendy, it gets the social stamp of approval. I think if people returned to valuing well crafted clothing that lasted a long time rather than cheap fast fashion, we could reverse the trends of fast fashion. One point that I really enjoyed in the reading was that often times, companies are not creating necessary innovations. Instead, the creation of a slimmer design or the release of a product in new colors is what is released by manufacturers. Without these changes in product design, these companies would have lower sales due to the smaller demand for their products among consumers. To be a more cautious and environmentally consumer, I believe that shoppers should look for good quality items that will last them a few years rather than giving into fleeting trends.

Reading “The Waste Makers” was truly eye-opening and it made me realize how wasteful we as Americans are. Vance Packard, the author of “The Waste Makers” notes, “recent exhortations for greater consumption have been inspired by bulging inventories of goods, which in turn are caused primarily by two factors. One is the ever-growing efficiency of the United States productive force, thanks in large part to the introduction of automated equipment in the offices and factories of nearly a hundred thousand United States companies. During the postwar years, the amount of goods and services that one man can turn out in an hour has increased about three percent every year. This increased output can be absorbed if each citizen consumes more, or if there are, each year, more citizens. Otherwise, then~ will be less work.” I agree with this statement because both of these factors are what caused the trend of consumerism. Packard also notes that, “Another tack that the marketers took was to try to induce Americans to demand more with each product bought. It should be either bigger or more complex, or both, in order to be appropriate for modern living. The goal was to justify a higher price tag.” This is true and can be observed today. Many companies such as Apple and Sony attempt to convince their customers that they need the latest model of technology available. From a business standpoint, it is a genius idea, but from an environmental standpoint, it is quite harmful. We as Americans need to get rid of the notion that more is better and will make us happier, when in reality that doesn’t make us happier at all. Take a look at celebrities and you can see many of them aren’t truly happy despite having more than others. What can make people happy is living in an environment with clean air, efficient clean energy, and more.

I agree with your comments about large corporations like Sony and Apple. While reading “The Waste Makers” by Vance Packard, the section on marketing “forced consumption” is very relevant in our rapid consumerist society, marketing a new product for American demand that is bigger or more complex. Although Vance’s example of lawn mowers is outdated, it reminds me of the societal transition from flip phones to smart phones. When people found out about the first iPhones, they ditched their flip phones to get the latest and greatest. The first company that comes to mind is Apple; Apple is constantly producing new iPads, iPods, MacBooks, and of course iPhones. For the most part, the function of every iPhone has been the same for the past decade; Apple just tweaks the layout of the phone and improves some of the qualities, the biggest two being battery life and camera. To Americans, buying the latest iPhone is a way to get temporary happiness, as Sebastian points out, but in the long run, the newest iPhone can’t make us happy forever. A year later when Apple introduces the nest iPhone, Americans become unhappy with their one-year-old phone and, again, want the new phone when nothing is wrong with their current one. Forced Consumption is a viscous cycle and must be halted to fix the problems of the climate crisis.

In Chapter 5 of the “The Waste Makers”, one statement especially stood out to me. “U.S. consumers no longer hold on to suits, coats, and dresses as if they were heirlooms .... Furniture, refrigerators, rugs-all once bought to last for years or life are now replaced with register-tingling regularity." This American mindset of quick purchase to disposal time has been integrated into our economy since the early 1900s. Instead of holding onto items for long periods of item,  making the most use out of them, Americans instead are attracted by new gleaming items that will replace sufficient ones that they already have. This mentality applies to more than just clothes; it applies to food, electronic appliances, toys, etc. It even applies to sky scrapers, as a quote from Engineering News Record cleverly compares this buy quick and dispose quick mindset to how the USA might be the only country to replace a skyscraper for another skyscraper. In order for us to move towards a more environmentally efficient economy, it is important for us to not buy things unnecessarily. Though it may feel that not buying just one extra item may not make a difference, it is shocking how much of a difference it can actually make if everyone adopts this mentality.

It's difficult to get out of the habit of consumerism, unless we're introduced to this new perspective.
    <br><br>

What happens with consumerism behind the scene? Who is creating these ads? Are our best interests in mind?(typically no) How did we transition into this consumerism depended society? How do we wean ourselves off of it.
    <br><br>

The reason we find ourselves in such a consumerism dependent economy is because of money profiting the small group of people who own these large corporations. They've successfully develpoed ways in which we are in a constant cycle of buy, use, throw away, buy use throw away, buy...etc. It's a detrimental cycle that only benefits that small group of people. It wreaks havoc on everything else: the planet, our wallets, and the mental health of consumers. It's overall an ineffective way to grow our economy and will ultimately hurt in the long run.
    <br><br>

The first step of combatting consumerism is teaching people about the manipulation of large corporations. It's important the the public knows the tactics behind these companies so that they can recognize when it's being used against them. 
    <br><br>

The public, at its current state, is sort of in a confused, brainwashed, daze. They trust these large corporations which make and sell their newest favorite items. They're following these corporations aimlessly, and this is a dangerous disease. The public needs to be snapped out of this daze and recognize their actions. One important part of combating consumerism is to be aware. Know what you're buying, why you're buying it, where it come's from, how big is its carbon footprint, and should you buy it? There are many questions but it is important to know the background of the items you're buying.
    <br><br>

This book can greatly help this cause. It does an excellent job of describing consumerism, but from the point of these corporations. Educating the public is the most important thing that can be done.

When I read the concept of planned obsolescence, I felt anger towards these companies not only because they mass manufacture these products but also because they fund marketing and advertisements that twist our mind into wanting more. Even if you aren't an environmentalist you can clearly see that our consumer culture in America is harmful to its people. With the amount of products people buy a year its crazy how much waste is produced. We are creating more waste than we can handle, most of these companies’ mass produce without even considering how to properly dispose of their products. I think the companies are 100% at fault for creating our obsession with consumer stuff that is wreaking havoc on our planet. It stems from how they engrain the idea that more and newer is better. This is a toxic trait that needs to be address if we are to move to a more sustainable future

After reading “The Waste Maker”,  i had a better understanding of consumerism and i started to truly realized how serious the consumerism is nowadays especially in America. 
    <br><br>
I never realize that most of the products’ improvement are actually made for company to further sell by attracting their old customers to buy more of their products. This made me think of the improvement i’ve saw on the production i’ve purchased. Like my laptop from apple company. As we know, we can always see advertisements from apple company of releasing new electronic products almost every year especially the improvement of old products like new phones iPhone 11 or new computer. Theses advertisements are actually really attractive as they list the new functions and improvements of the new products and these can especially effectively attract old customer. As for me, i just purchased a new iPhone 11 on impulse. Actually i was using a iPhoneX which looked still new and have no problems in using. But i just attracted by the advertisement of new iphone11 by its improved camera, and what’s more, to follow the trend. However, i am a little bit regretted because it’s unnecessary for me to waste a large amount of money on a new phone which have no difference in use with my old phone. Apple company did make some real improvement on the new products which would be useful for some person. However, there are many company make totally unnecessary and useless improvement on their products and make fancy advertisements which make people believe their new products are better. This would only cause a waste. 
    <br><br>
Also, there are some companies lower their products’ quality and keep releasing latest clothes to encourage people to buy more clothes. This is actually wasteful. But in the reading, it is said that economics growth need people to purchase and this is exactly what economics want.

“The Waste Makers” has probably been my favorite reading thus far. The way in which our economy has been framed has set us up to be mindless consumers, and it is rather unfair, and it is clear that it has been going on for a while judging by this book. As Packard notes, the economy is dependent on the willingness of consumers and the government to spend more and more each year than the last. While it’s not a ridiculous assumption for a still somewhat developing country, the mindset behind it isn’t great. In order to do this, people needed any reasonable excuse to purchase a product. So companies start churning out cheaper products, start inducing people to throw things away and keep replacing them due to the creation of disposable dinners, foods, bags, etc., and as a result the quality of services decline. One company’s practices that stood out to me while reading was the Holland Furnace Company. They sent salesmen to people’s homes offering free inspections on furnaces, and once they gained access to the home, they would dismantle the furnace and then refuse to put it back together as it was “dangerous” or “beyond repair”. How unethical and manipulative do you need to be as a company to gain profits? Doesn’t being a reputable and respected one actually count for something? But we as consumers allow this to continue (Holland did get caught but there are still major companies out there today that definitely manipulate their consumers). We don’t have high enough standards and morals for companies. We do just mindlessly consume what they put out, despite their products either not being as good as they could be, or the fact that they actually inconvenience us (aka Apple). Some of the biggest problems with our consumption come from the 3 types of obsolescence: function, quality, desirability. When done intentionally and maliciously, quality is the worst of the 3. For a company to put out a product that is designed to fall apart just so people have to pay to replace it is not okay. Consumers need to prove that it is not okay by not purchasing those products, because it does seem like the only way to get companies to stop doing that. If they can’t make profits, then they will be forced to change for the better, which helps everybody. But I honestly have little hope of this happening. We just don’t care enough as a whole, and convincing people seems like an impossible task when they just want the next best thing.

I 100% second you on the manipulative and unethical practices of some companies. One that specifically stood out for me in Waste Makers was the teeth example where the dentist removed all of the fillings because they were “getting pretty old” and also because “It would save money in the long run”. Not only did he shake his head no, the dentist went ahead and changed the subject. It really is quite unfortunate that these companies and specific people target the vulnerable and make them seem like they are trustful and you should listen to any recommendations that they give. 
    <br><br>


I too have little hope when the major corporations have major power over people. From the time people are born, companies are throwing their advertisements all over the place. This is why I think we should not only change our relationship with consumer goods, but also vote with our money, and vote for restrictions on companies.

Similar to you, Packard's point about how the perpetual growth of the economy is reliant on increased consumer spending each year resonated with me. I have always noticed that reports on the strength of the economy are always based on growth statistics. Similarly, investment is companies is, by definition, tied to future growth and forces companies to base their mission around increasing sales each year. As Packard explains, this system provides an incentive for companies to manipulate consumers to achieve growth instead of considering the side effects of overproduction. As Ken mentioned in this video, the best comparison for this system is a machine, as it continues to go and churn out the byproduct of waste and environmental damage and there is seemingly no way to stop it. I think that my interest in this specific lense of looking at one cause of the climate crisis is that it focuses on a specific root cause of the cultural problems that contribute to the problems examined in this course. 
    <br><br>
As I have noted in previous comments, I think the only way to address the broader climate crisis is through cultural changes. This book assesses how companies drive the consumerist culture and how it directly lead to waste. While I am not sure what is the best way to address the malfeasance of companies, I do think this is an issue we need to address quickly, and likely by reversing the corporate conditioning of consumers to alter their behavior. Packard talks extensively about how the advertising and presentation of products are meant to manipulate customers. These methods have been very effective, and I think similar techniques can be used in the other direction to reverse this behavior. For instance, many countries put images of cancer patients on cigarette boxes to remind people of the risks of smoking. Imagine if each plastic bottle your bot had a large picture of trash piles in the Pacific Ocean. Would that cause people to hesitate before buying it? While it may not be a comprehensive solution, that type of consumer education strategy could be a good way to start addressing this problem.

As someone who actively considers themselves socially conscious, I was absolutely stunned by this week’s reading. Despite the fact that this book was written over half a century ago, it was obvious how many of the different tactics used by corporations that were discussed in the text are still extremely prominent today. The reading this week not only left me disgusted, but with a serious sense of unease. Knowing that I have been manipulated by businesses throughout my entire life simply as a tool is absolutely horrifying. I hate thinking about the fact that we as humans seem to have very little free will under the capitalist culture that we live in. It sometimes feels like our entire lives are just a gradual process of us being manipulated by people with power. 
    <br><br>

This week’s reading truly shows how deeply ingrained consumerism is in our lives in almost every facet. We are taught to consume anything and everything we can from a small age. While this isn’t the first time I had thought about this idea, the reading for this week did a great job of outlining the ways in which our consumer culture was really born. After the end of the Second World War, the United States was thrust into an unprecedented level of global power and control. During this time, powerful interests realized they had the opportunity to establish whatever culture they wanted. This ended up being dominated by consumerism, simply because having a society where the populus wants to spend money on things is incredibly useful to those who can make money and gain power by selling. The reading outlined the various ways that companies have attempted to make us want to discard things faster and faster. While this was true 60 years ago, it’s even more blatant now. New “iPhones' ' come out every year, and they are literally designed to shut down after a few years of usage so that people will be incentivized to buy more. This is an example of a toxic element of our culture that Packard identified half a century ago and still resonates today.

We have been talking about how the corporations have been trying to prevent any bill and regulation from passing, how they interfere with politics and science to convince us to use and consume their products. While these tricks they use are obvious, I am shocked to know that the system itself, which has been supporting and improving the economy for the better, is not sustainable.
      <br><br>
  The Waste Makers exposes many tactics that the industries have used to trick us into consumerism decades ago—over advertising and planned obsolescence. This reminds me of Apple, who admitted in 2017 to slow down old iPhones and iPads with new system updates for the purpose of getting people to buy the latest version of Apple products, even though the older devices are still completely usable—obsolescence of quality. The brand-new iPad Air 2 I got from my high school in 2016 was rendered useless after 2 years because of battery failure, but the iPad 3 I got in 2013 is still perfectly usable today. Of course my personal experience will not prove the general case, but it is very concerning issue since it is not something that people would notice with a couple of broken stuff—I certainly didn’t think so when my new iPad broke. This practice of planned obsolescence, as noted in The Waste Makers, was carried out long before we were even born. And what’s more shocking from these chapters is that engineers have to work against their ethics, make stuff worse instead of better. Currently in mechanical engineering major, it worries me that I may too have to face the dilemma—choose to either make stuff better but against the will of the corporations, or make stuff replaceable—in the future.
      <br><br>
   Of course we know that the corporations have been selling their lies to us for decades, stuffing up our lives with things that we don’t need, and the production of this system has exceeded the limit of nature. We as the consumers need to value the stuff that we buy and don’t turn into a shopping maniac. But The Waste Makers tells us that changing ourselves won’t be enough—we will still buy bad products from them. We need the corporations to change too, and it seems that it is going to be a difficult thing to do, since the selling of these products is linked to employment, to national economy, and to many more aspects of our lives.

After reading chapter 2-7 of the waste maker I was very informed about how our depression and large government spending and the government endorsing individual spending led to our unsustainable economy and lifestyles. The way the author simplifies how our economy snowball evolved to this point and is continuing too was very well presented and informative for how complex and lengthy of a topic he covered in about 70 pages. While Professor Hiltner asks for our opinion on who we feel is responsible for our mess reaching this point, I believe it can't be pointed to one group but collectively to everyone collectively. The government over supported spending just to spend even though the amount people were spending wasn't the issue and gave a lot of money to force growth but lead to creating a supply that was larger than needed. The manufacturing sector though sought to meet these government messages and keep profit growing so they severely increased output while decreasing reliability to see these ever-growing stocks of supplies. The general public also supported these messages and pressures and also boasts and spreads the want for these goods. So personally I feel everyone is at fault because these mass-production industries are dependent on every part to continue what they've been doing to increase profits so at any time one part of this environmentally destructive chain could have been broken. 
      <br><br>

Personally what I feel is keeping these large industries going is people's fears of failure and another recession like in the early 1900s. The reason why is as stated in the book whenever the amount of production in the US can't be met the economy witnesses a form of recession usually followed by more people spending to keep correcting the economy. I believe we should switch back to the limited releases of clothing and reliable products even if it means a slight recession so we can correct our shopping addiction and fix the economy in another sustainable way.

By watching Ken’s lecture, I started to think about the cultural aspects of environmental issues carefully. In the past, I usually think environmental issue from a relatively scientific perspective, but now I start to realize the significant role culture plays in this issue. Specifically, cultural trend created by companies’ marketing strategies can change consumer behavior and thus the flow of stuff. These cultural trends, according to The Waste Makers, are called planned obsolescence, which includes obsolescence of function, quality, and desirability. All sorts of planned obsolescence aim to promote the renew of products and thus increase of sales, but this can also lead to reduction of natural resources, which, without careful management, can lead to disruption to ecosystems and depletion of resources. Consumer behavior as a result of marketing is most likely to be irrational and unnecessary, as people are not buying what they need, but what they FEEL like they need. This can result in fast substitution of products and quicker generation of wastes, which certainly have detrimental effect on our environment. I think we need to do something about this kind of irrational consumer behavior. 
       <br><br>

Currently I am also reading The Story of Stuff by Annie Leonard, which reveals similar situations as The Waste Makers does and provides multiple sound solutions. For example, manufacturers should increase the efficiency of material use of their products. On the other hand, consumers should be rational about their purchasing behavior and reduce overall consumption. When both the supply chain and demand side put efforts into preserving natural resources, our planet is likely to have a bright future. I previously thought that this is very hard to realize since most companies focus on interests, but when I thought about that, companies like Patagonia just popped up in my mind. I believe there is always a way through which companies can both produce high-quality products and earn profits and popularity. Have a few things that are good can not only benefit our environment but also simplify our life and improve our working efficiency and life quality, so, why not?

After reading Vance Packard’s pioneering 1960 work The Waste Makers, I get a better understand on materialism of American life. The book vividly depicts how the rapid growth of disposable consumer goods was degrading the environmental, financial, and spiritual character of American society.
       <br><br>
The book explores the growing commercialization of American life – the development of consumption for consumption's sake. Packard outlines ways that manufacturers and advertisers can persuade consumers to buy things they do not need or did not know they wanted. Producers always appeal to consumers to buy something because it is more expensive or because it is painted in a new color. The book also draws attention to the concept of planned obsolescence. In planned obsolescence, products are given a “death date” so that they wear out quickly and need to be replaced. Packard argues that by manipulating the public into mindless consumerism, business is making us “more wasteful, reckless and carefree in our consumption habits,” consuming our natural resources at an alarming rate.
       <br><br>
It is true that nowadays people still replace their items with a brand-new one only because the new product is better. For example, Apple invents new products every year. Many people buy an updated iPhone as soon as it is on sale. The older one is still working. However, electric quantity goes down quickly, internal storage is filled by many applications, and the screen is broken. Those producers just grasp consumers’ hearts and invented a better-functioned product. Thus, consumers will purchase new products even though they do not have to buy immediately.

Reading "The Waste Makers" definitely provides insight to the dark history of American consumerism and how it has dangerously become one that promotes the notion of the newer something is, the better it is. It's interesting how this concept has become so instilled within American mindset because most of it stems from America wanting to be an economically strong nation. The strategy of creating flimsy or inefficient products to promote buyers to buy more is definitely an interesting one. It's very toxic and unfair; large companies manipulate their buyers in order to have better sales, and as a result, everyone is suffering. Since most products aren't sustainable, people are shelling out more money and it feels more frustrating as a buyer.

       <br><br>

Consumption definitely varies from buyer to buyer. If one can self-regulate by educating themselves about what products are the most efficient in terms of long-time usage and cost, then they could mitigate lots of money being spent. But most buyers definitely do not spend a lot of time doing research thanks to different methods used to lure impatient buyers in.

I 100% agree with you Justin. Reading “The Waste Maker” has really shown me insight into how America became obsessed with consumer culture. Yes, one can blame the individual citizen but what is behind these social and environmental injustices are the large corporations and companies. These companies changed American culture and values by instilling the need to constantly buy more. They came up with genius ways to make the public by more by use of planned obsolescence. I’m disgusted by this because I grew up in a culture that was defined by corporations that have the sole purpose of making more money and destroying the environment. I’ve been trained to want the newest thing. I want the newest and most fashionable clothes, I want the newest tech but I now realize this was all one giant marketing trick. I really don’t need all of these things, and I’m disgusted how capitalism has entrenched these beliefs into our society.

After reading “The Waste Makers”, it opened up my mind so much because I never realized the ways the fashion industry or whatever industry that is trying to profit off of consumers use cheap quality or mental advertisements that want you to consistently buy new things. When I read the part where they have a product where it is supposed to last at least 5 years but they switch it up and make their lifeline to be only 2-3 years instead so you could buy a new and updated model of the same item. This reminds me of phones because Apple constantly comes out with new products that are nearly identical but has slightly different functions that are not that noticeable but everyone lines up to buy it because it is the norm these days to have the newest, latest form of anything. I remember when iPads came out, everyone was like “wow we have to get it”, after a period, the hype started to die off and then it became popular again when Apple decided that it would be great for school and taking notes. Nowadays, everyone in the lecture hall has one and it symbolizes that you have money to afford an iPad for school. This is actually a really good tactic to target college students because parents just want the best for the child especially if they’re attending school and then the child can introduce the multiple functions that the iPad has. This might result in the parent wanting one, telling their friends about it and it becomes a cycle until the next updated product comes out. I can see how this becomes a wasteful cycle because what happens to the unused phones and old iPads? Just like Teslas, to even produce it caused carbon emission and this is not good for the environment.

I agree with how you felt in terms of feeling so oblivious to the manipulative strategies that the fashion industry used to get consumers to purchase their unnecessary items. What also infuriated me was how companies are making their products have a lower life expectancy, so consumers would be forced to purchase their “new and improved” products. For example, how you brought up that in the reading there was a product that was supposed to last at least 5 years, but was switched to only 2-3 years, so consumers could buy the “new and updated model of the same model”. I agree with your claims that companies such as Apple come out with “new” products that are nearly identical to the older models, to sell them to people who are gullible enough to fall for their ploy. 
        <br><br>
I definitely relate with reactions everyone had when new technology such as the iPad came out. That was actually my reaction when I found out about iPhones and iPads. Even then, since I was a kid, I’ve always been intrigued with new technology. Nowadays companies are just selling the same products they sold the previous year, but with minor improvements. As Mr.Weiss complained that much of the product improvement “has tended increasingly toward small details of trim…” And since most of our society is based on materialism, and is always wanting the newest products, everyone is always determined to do whatever they can to get that product. That’s why many people in school have the newest and latest technology, because some people want to be validated by people that also have those products. 
        <br><br>
The sad part is that people are going to continue to be gullible enough to keep buying “new” products, until they become obsolete, which the cycle will then repeat itself.

Packard’s “The Waste Makers” perfectly defines the consumerist culture and the greed of corporations in society. When he mentioned how companies would plan obsolescence of their products in order to increase profit, Apple’s business model came to my mind. Theoretically, iPhones can last many years but since Apple wants to generate as much profit as possible, they release new iPhones every year that just have minor “upgrades” from the previous model. In the past, Apple revolutionized the cell phone industry with each new release. But now, they are only releasing new phone models every year so consumers can brag about how they got the newest iPhone model. It’s disappointing that consumerist culture revolves around owning the newest, most fashionable product and it is even more so disappointing to see how much Apple is profiting off that culture. Many people, like myself, like to hold on to their electronics until they are no longer usable but companies like Apple purposely throttle their older devices’ usability so consumers are forced to buy a newer phone. Planned obsolescence is a plague to society and the greed and corruption of corporations is responsible for the mass increase of waste on this planet.

Packard shares some interesting points and perspectives in this book that I had not considered before. For example on page 7 he explains “Man throughout recorded history has struggled - often against appalling odds - to cope with material scarcity...The great challenge in the United States - and soon in Western Europe - is to cope with a threatened overabundance of the staples and amenities and frills of life” (7). I have never thought about how long Man’s main concern was having enough to survive, whether it be food, warmth, etc. It’s understandable that once humans got enough to survive, their instinct was to obtain as much as possible to secure and guarantee their safety. I had never thought of it that way. It makes sense that we now have an overabundance of stuff, and humans’ want for “stuff” isn’t decreasing. It doesn’t help that in the twentieth century the United States wanted to increase the demand for products and goods, so they could keep up with Russia’s growth at the time, something Packard talks about in Chapter 3. We were so competitive that we didn’t even consider what would happen as a result of this. A lot of America’s problems stem from being so competitive and worrying about money and status, that we blindly do things without considering the repercussions in the future.

The Vance Packard reading definitely made me think of the many ways our lives are shaped by consumerism. Our society has been conditioned over generations to spend money on things that we do not necessarily need. I'd say that corporate America has succeeded in that regard. They have been able to harness the power of marketing to encourage us all to spend more money. It's always about having the newest things no matter the environmental cost. This "throwaway spirit" that Packard talks about is still relevant today. We still have the throwaway spirit. We are more likely to just buy a replacement for something that we have that just needs a quick repair. In some cases, buying a replacement costs less than just repairing it. 

        <br><br>

Planned obsolescence is one of the most destructive things that companies are doing right now. Its more problematic now than ever because a lot of products are internet-connected. A company that sells an internet-connected product can easily just drop support for it later down the road to force people to buy new versions of the same product. An example that represents this issue is Sonos, a smart speaker company that's in Santa Barbara. They are currently going through a scandal where they are dropping support for some of their smart speakers that they released 5 years ago. The products that they are declaring as "legacy" will no longer be eligible to receive updates that are usually implemented to patch security flaws in their software.

I thought that I already knew most of the basic concepts of what was talked about in "wastemakers," however, I didn't know just how bad planned obsolescence was.  It blows my mind how huge companies are able to brainwash and manipulate a vast majority of the population to believe that to be content we always need to stay "on trend" and that old things are out of fashion.  This consumerism seems to be the most apparent to me in the technology industry.  Apple comes out with a new phone model every year, and so many people "upgrade" for next best model-even if the current model they have has nothing wrong with it.   The rise of consumerism has made us feel that we always have to stay on trend, and that having the newest and best things is what brings us happiness.  It seems like everyone's life revolves around buying "stuff"; the average workweek is 40 hours; 40 hours to make money so that you can buy more things.  While reading this I remembered what Ken was talking about last week -- how if every year you put the money you spent to own a car into a savings account for retirement you could retire years and years earlier than what is "normal" in the U.S.  This is, however, an intangible reality for most young people, as it seems like we are quick to spend our money on the latest technology and fashion.  I also didn't know how much WWII influenced this consumerism, and it was eye-opening to read about how the need to keep the economy up led to big companies hyping up the idea of always buying things, but unfortunately, this leads to never being satisfied with what we already have.  I've seen so many people who buy so many seemingly unnecessary things, like new clothes to go to parties or random accessories, because they think it will bring them joy, but then will go and complain about how they don't have enough money to buy groceries or go out to get food.  However, I don't think this is the fault of the consumer -- but the fault of the producers -- who constantly glamorize the endless desire of ownership.

"The Waste Makers" by Packard shed light on how American consumerism has created a society that doesn't market efficiency and instead milks the American people into believing that they have to constantly "upgrade" what they own instead of maintaining it and keeping their resources to a minimum. In the reading, we see within the overproduction of materials and how companies use the idea of the necessity to their benefit and create an overproduction of products for companies to maintain a profit. This observation of a system created to make a profit angers me cause it damages everything around us, with this system was not just taking away from the environment and doing extreme damages to it we are also damaging our mind and body by allowing our priorities to be consumed by materialism. In my opinion, this reading shows how companies have manipulated our freedom of choice by overfeeding us things with these minor "improvements" that have been in the vault since they first manufactured their products. Overall, this reading helped me understand prior to watching The True Cost, the machine that companies have created to maintain a profit.

The economic relationship between supply and demand curve which is explained by Vance Packard in his book “The Waste Makers” is the key ingredient that leads to the wasting consumerism culture in America. Thanks to the insistent rise of the technology, the outputs can be generated far more efficiently with the same input under the help of automatic machines comparing to  the productivity several years ago. Nevertheless, most of products can have a long life span which means it is unnecessary for one to buy those products one per year. Then, here comes the problem: even though the outputs are being raised up, the fact that the supply of output greatly outnumbers the demand for them may well cause the pressure of inventory on suppliers. Therefore, companies have to bring up some brilliant ideas to grab the consumers’ sights, which to increase their sell. 
        <br><br>

 Then, three ideas are being introduced as basic sales technique: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of desirability and obsolescence of quality. For the first one, obsolescence of function, it is unavoidable in that with the rise of technology, the innovative of products is being introduced in everyone’s daily life to raise up their living standard. However, certainly, enough sweat, long working hours and funds are being devoted by researchers on generating those innovative products. Even worse, sometimes the wrong research direction may well generates nothing but disappointment, which is against the companies primary goal: profits maximization. Therefore, sometimes companies will utilize the obsolescence of function as a stunt to increase the demand, whereas the truth is the function of the second-generation of products shares the same function with the first one with different appearance. Because of curiosity and the willingness to jump into the bandwagon of the pursue of high-tech era, consumers are willing to pay the bill for those so-called new products. As for the second and the third sales method mentioned in the book, they are completely the products of the companies’ greed. Although they hold the productive methods to increase the life-span of the products they produce, they are reluctant to do it since once if the far more durable products are being introduced, their sales will descend greatly. Therefore, oppositely, companies will make a product with shorter life span deliberately, a way to stimulate the demand of products. Meanwhile, the concept of fashion trend is being injected to our era. Especially the young generation is eager to pursue the so-called fashion trend and is reluctant to use the “obsolete” products that may well make others laugh at them. The companies ,for instance, the cloth companies, grasp the mindset of the young generation, facilitating the concept that there are 52 seasons per year for one to buy new clothes comparing to only 4 seasons for one to but clothes.

One part I found extremely interesting while reading The Waste Makers was that manufacturers will make their product not last as long so that consumers will have to buy more and more of their products. The one product that immediately came to mind was iPhones, since they are known to slow down older generations of their phones when new ones come out. Many people who own iPhones have reported that as soon as the next generation is announced their older phone stops working out of nowhere and that is not a coincidence. I believe that fast fashion companies also use the same method of not making their clothing high quality so that people have to continue to buy more and more clothes. Another part I couldn't believe was the companies, like Holland Furnace Company, convince people that they need to buy their new products by telling them that their old ones do not work anymore. This system of buying and throwing away after only a little bit is so deep in our society that it will be hard to change unless these companies that are perpetuating this system change it. It also saddens me that so many people throw away their things, like clothing or old phones, instead of donating them to people that really need them. Some people outgrow their things and decide to throw them away when someone out there can make use of them. This is why I believe donating should be seen as more important and more well known for people.

“America’s capacity to produce may have outstripped its capacity to consume,” is a quote that stuck out to me simply because it was really able to illustrate the reality of what consumerism was back then and what it is now. The reality of consumerism has dated back to the early 1900’s and has become a culture that we have all adopted unconsciously. To be quite honest, learning that 2/5 of the things we own are not essential to our well being isn’t really surprising. This week’s reading has really allowed to be to become more aware of how capitalism is so deeply embedded into our society that it poses the question as to what we can do to reduce the “waste machine” that is American consumerism. Chapter 4 really caught my attention because it’s truly reflective of our society today. It talked about how clothing and cosmetic companies target women and influence them that they need things when they don’t. Looking at our society today with the beauty industry because of the amount of make-up pallets that come out on a daily basis. Before this class, I wasn’t really aware of how living in a house contributes to our climate crisis. Coming from parents who are immigrants, owning a house meant success to them and on top of that owning multiple cars. In other words, every person in our house has a car that we can each use individually. That alone is environmentally detrimental. What I got out of this week is that not many of us are aware as to how privilege is singlehandedly one going to bring us to our doom.

The “The Waste Makers” opened my eyes to a new perception of consumerism. I never think of what happens after we use up our clothes and don’t want it anymore. We are constantly buying clothes, accessories, and automobiles and the producers are creating more than what we can buy. This is creating a consumer culture and which we live in now. We buy and waste and it’s a never ending cycle. My mom and dad in my life span have owned close to 10 cars which is absurd since they only use one each and where do those cars end up? In lots to never be used or to be decomposed creating huge amounts of scrap.
         <br><br>

However this isn’t the only issue, companies are warping reality with commercials and propaganda that make the company seem harmless and promising to people especially kids who are the ones that will end up buying from those companies in the future which is sickening .

I really agree with everything that Jorge talked about. A lot of what he said really crossed my mind as I read the article and then watched Kenneth introduce it in this video. That being said, something that really popped up to me is the fact that companies have become so good at manipulating you into believing working material is either obsolete or that certain objects have a very small lifespan. It really is a cycle as Jorge says, we continually buy for the new fashion and then replace it when the fashion cycle changes once again. Your analogy with your parents' cars is a good example of what consumer culture has progressed to, similarily, I have also had some experience with the effects of consumerism as my parents routinely buy clothes while not having worn clothes that they have bought recently. Not only is this a waste of money and space, oftentimes, these clothes also will never be worn as they will find a similar object that outvalues in fashion. This just continually creates more and more waste and more waste equals more problems for the future and the present. Finally, something that I really felt passionate about was the fact that companies will advocate their products knowing that they are detrimental to the consumers health, such as cigarettes for example. Not only is this extremely evil, but their refusal to acknowledge their involvement also is fundamentally absurd and should be an imprisonable offense.

After I read Chapter 2-7 of the book "The Waste Makers," I have learned how consumerism develop and evolve in American society. It is shockingly true that the ideology of modern-day consumerism is still unmatured. Companies have invested a huge amount of money on advertisement to encourage consumers to buy their products. As a result, there are lots of resources being wasted by consumers because many things are overly produced to satisfy peoples' needs. Like a vicious cycle, consumers want to spend my money on luxury items to make their life better; products are overproduced by corporations to gain more profit from consumers. In the process of manufacturing new items, CO2 emissions have increased, and a tremendous amount of resources have been wasted.
         <br><br>
An example I come up with is the Apple battery life scandal a few years ago. Apple has been secretly slowing the performance of older iPhones so that people are willing to buy a new iPhone because of the bad performance. Consumers are usually the first group to be blamed because of the huge amount of waste they produce, however, corporations are also guilty because they encourage unhealthy consumerism to gain profit.

I’ve heard about consumerism but have never dug so deep before. I gain happiness from consuming and purchasing flamboyant stuff, such as baubles and cosmetic products that I can never use up. That kind of satisfaction and happiness will push me to make irrational decisions during shopping. Sometimes I will realize I was driven by impulse but the recognition on this level cannot stop me from doing this next time. People in my hometown can’t help themselves buying bigger houses and wider cars in their way of accruing wealth. The elongate version of Audi A8 -- A8L -- sells a lot more than the normal wheelbase version. Big houses and luxury cars are considered one’s identity in my hometown. The society cannot realize the superficial ethos, and thus the general public immersed in it are scoured over and over again.
         <br><br>

As Ken mentioned in the video, oil and fashion industries are the biggest two industries that produce a huge amount of CO2 emission. The problems should be solved from the origin. After I read “Walden” and “The Waste Makers,” I’m sure that everyone who resides on the Earth should read these two books. The Earth needs its residents to realize the basis for sustainable development and learn the lifestyle of minimalism.

fast since all these years. And the book reveals the problem:causing a lot of waste behind the mass production of products. One thing that it showed me and make me feel scared is how our market has been pushing and creating the idea that more goods are needed to be produced and to have a balance and prosperous economy, we need more consumers to buy the goods. That’s why people are always told that they should and need to buy so many things as possible to make the economy survive.
         <br><br>
The reading makes me understand some of the techniques and skills the producer have been using to attract people to buy their products. It is not only frightening that the ideas of doing this is to get the products to be sold. But doing this means people are buying more stuffs they actually don’t need, and people are throwing away stuff easily that they didn’t use for so many times, thus creating more and more waste.
         <br><br>
I totally understand the few things that mentioned in the book, for example, the ads are always telling people what they should buy and what they need, and after they buy one thing, they will persuade them to buy another, and going on and on. Also, the most interesting thing mentioned in the book and which many of us personally experienced is that products are created with planned short life and new products are made soon to replace the old one. Jus like our computers and phones or some type of clothes.The new one and the old one don't change a lot or have a big difference, but this is what the producers are doing to get people to buy more and throw away the old one.
         <br><br>
Reading this book makes me understand how much waste we have been making from just buying and using products/goods that are sold intentionally by the sellers. What I think w all should do is to rethink the way and speed on how we produce and purchase stuff. Creating such more and more waste is only adding more burden to this planet and creating more environmental problems.

After reading chapters (2-7) of The Waste Makers, the author Vance Packard explains to us that there are three types of “planned obsolescence”: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability. While the first one, obsolescence of function is reasonable, I believe the other two are born from both the manufacturers and consumers. That is, manufacturers produce more in order to earn more profits, and consumers buy more due to personal satisfaction. None of these two sides are considering factors such as how much natural resources were taken, how badly the environment is harmed, and how much waste is going to be produced. 
         <br><br>
I am one of the blinded consumers that had been “brainwashed” by companies into believing the slogan that “the newer the better”. But to be honest, the thing that drives us to have such a crazy grave for “stuff” is greed. We throwaway or switch our phones or clothes not because they worn out, they are just, not new anymore. Sure, companies and manufacturers are responsible for putting ads everywhere in our daily life, but what if we can stop our own from falling into their traps? This doesn’t mean we should stop buying things, what we need to do is be smart on how we spend and choose to buy items that are truly important and essential.

Reading notes:
         <br><br>
This is the second week we talk about consumerism's awful impacts on the environment but in this case Ken has given us more of a historical look to the beginnings of the consumer market. And I was torn. In one hand I'm angered by the degradation of our resources/ destruction of habitats/killing of flora and fauna and in the other hand I understand the choice to consume more was to bring prosperity back to a failing economy. Now, though, we don't have to many threats to our economy as we once did so we are not seduced from the harm we do to our planet. So we need to tone it way down with our constant buy, buy, buy.
         <br><br>
The way I see it is we have been, essentially, groomed by our own government and Corporations. Consumerism it seems is a trend of compulsive spending on more, more phones, more shirts, more whatever; but to the scale that you've been trained to do. For example, Packard explains how an early consumerism market was during the U.S.'s first recession when they were literally told by the president to buy because was a way to fix the recession. Granted it seems as if it was said under good intentions because recessions aren't great- especially for the poor. This boosted the economy and made jobs; but at the same time it screwed over the environment. This fast consumer ideology has only continued to grow with advertisers selling products that no one really needs. So we have essentially locked ourselves in this toxic cycle of buying for our never ending needs but at the same time destroying our planet through the demand of resources and volumes of trash.





</p><hr>


<p>

It's pretty disgusting knowing how much these brands we've grown up with are so skilled, for years and years, at being the prime manipulator and controlling factor in our lives. It's almost like we're in a toxic relationship, but do note it goes both ways. We're the ones enabling this behavior. Packard mentions this need for more, and bigger things on top of that. It doesn't matter whether or not it's even that effective, just if they claim to be. We're actually spending more money for things that are even less durable, meaning they'll just need to be replaced sooner and then you'll need to pay even more money. It's just a ruthless cycle of rinse and repeat, all the while destroying even more of the planet and wasting resources.

         <br><br>

I found the quote that Packard uses, that at some point, "babies come in bottles, and zombie-like citizens move about in doped-up bliss" is such an efficient communicator of the lifestyle the modern American has come to adapt, blindly falling in line the corporate machines, buying into whatever claims they lay out hidden behind catchy tunes and flashy ads.

"Waste Makers" is as applicable is it was back then in the 1960's as it is now. Chapter 2 introduces various ways that companies advertise and sell their products in  a way that makes them "relevant." Sometimes products receive upgrades that make them better, like a PC, or in many cases the products is just repacked, re-purposed and re-advertised, as "something better" or "something you need." This was going on before my time and is still happening now. There's a new phone that comes out every year not much different from its predecessor (samsung or i phone comes to mind), there's some new fashion movement where people "must" buy it to look cool (like supreme, Jordans, or the latest Instagram sponsored fashion), or even new cars that are produced a year after with no real improvements besides looks and body type. Chapter 3 then goes into how we are being pushed into buying these products by advertisers. These no longer appear to be "luxuries" but rather, some sort of necessity that we apparently don't know about (i say this satirically). What if there was a way to make sure people who advertisers target, become vividly aware of this. A luxury tax comes to mind. Imagine the next time you buy TV and its one of those new 4k smart TVs, the store charges you a $30 dollar luxury tax that proportionally goes into recycling and processing that TV in the future. For other things like a fridge or stove, what if the luxury tax was waved for certain ecological models that encouraged people to buy long lasting better versions. What do y'all think about this?

After reading the first seven chapters of Vance Packard’s Making Waste of the Planet, I really got an in-depth view of what consumerism is like and how it has been consuming our lives for so long. We have surpassed the point of where we needed to produce enough for us to consume and are now at the extreme stage where our production capabilities have exceeded our ability to consume whatever we produce. I liked how Ken brought up the tobacco industry and how the companies tried falsifying or disproving certain evidence that was against them. This comparison made it easier for the audience to understand how climate change deniers are trying to reject the disastrous effects of climate change. The reason that both tobacco companies and major corporations with high carbon emission rates deny their respective detrimental effects is so that they can keep making significant amounts of profit. Tobacco companies don’t want people to realize that tobacco is disastrous to your health, so they deny the evidence so people keep buying tobacco products. This is very similar to how many large corporations deny climate change because they don’t want people to reduce the use of their product. I feel this is placing more importance on personal profit rather than the health of people and the earth, and I really hope that we can educate more people about the climate crisis and evict meaningful change to stop this phenomenon.

In "The Waste Makers", Paul Mazur goes into deep detail about the creation and expansion of consumer culture, describing the reasons behind its success by describing the strategies corporations use to keep this cycle of consumerism. He describes the "planned obsolescence" of companies to get consumers to get ride of the products they own and buy new versions of the same thing. This most commonly happens with cars, phones, and clothing, as each year of innovation brings new products. We are trained to habitually throw away items in perfect condition, letting greed rather than gratitude guide the way. A perfect example of this is the way apple comes out with a new iPhone, laptop, apple with act. every year. To own so many different versions of the same technology as well as wanting to get the newest version every year is extremely detrimental to the environment and a toxic culture to be a part of as humans.
         <br><br>
Brands make their products desirable through obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability. Obsolescence of quality and desirability are consequences of the consumers falling into the advertising, and "bigger, better faster" culture.
          <br><br>
I believe that although brands market to manipulate their consumers, if consumers individually, and eventually collectively raised awareness against this culture and stopped buying into it, manufacturers wouldn't supply as much of it. This goes back to the idea of supply and demand, and is a critical component to solving the climate change crisis. So long the new iPhones keep being bought each years, and clothes are thrown away and new ones are bought with changing seasons, we will be influencing these markets to continue expanding.



</p><hr>


<p>

What surprises me most about all this is that we still continue to support these companies like Apple even when we know that the products stop being fully functional after a few years. We have condoned a culture of owning the latest technology that even when we understand the consequences of our actions, we still do them just because everyone else is. Thrift stores and second-hand goods stores have been somewhat popular for a while now, but what I haven't seen are companies specializing in re-using iPhone and other technology parts. This wouldn't fix the problem of buying new products, but it would help with the material waste of letting the old technology sit in a drawer. The scary aspect is that although Packard's "Waste Makers" was published six decades ago it is still extremely relevant today

As the book suggests, “nearly two fifths of the things we owns are things that nor essential to our physical well beings.” After World War II, as the economy reborn, the average citizens eventually get all they need, and are affordable to consume the items other than the necessities. The situation is that almost every family already own the products that they need. As the book suggests, factories only left with three options: selling the replacement, making better products, or selling one more item to one family. The production we produced is no longer the need but more. However, to prevent the fall of the economy, the production and the consumption must continue to increase. It turns into such a bad result as the sellers need to produce more and make the consumers to buy more than they need.

I found the remarks made by Packard to be intriguing in regard to phasing out goods and the lengths manufacturers go in 'differentiating' each release they push to market. Of the most detrimental is aesthetic or often in the form of desirability. Just as product releases occur every year, often to little anticipation as we've arrived to the point that technological innovation has slowed down incredibly in regard to consumer end electronics. At fairs such as CES, while innovative in their own right, often the everyday products, some of which are showcased this event, are well relatively similar to their predecessors. Specifically in regard to phones, tablets and laptops. Companies such as Apple or Samsung release 'off' year products where the design does not change, while internal updates take place. While nice in their own regard, are something that could be said to wait for just a little longer. It's become something as a consumer base we've come to expect, and continue to buy into. In this way the fashion industry has begun to inform others around it, sharing some of its worst practices with others. Within Packard's writings, I found the obsolescence writings on quality and function interesting as their everyday practice is such on large scale with regard to how we view consumer electronics, cars and their parts (the harder it is to find them) as well as just colors within the fashion industry. I found Packard's approach in chapter  7 on the applied practice used in the women's fashion industry to that of the male counterpart of particular interest, in further spurring consumption. This also includes men's health currently, in the 'men's' and 'women's' marketing to alcohol, snacks, and personal hygiene goods. Most of the time to no real benefit or difference, other than social pressures.

It is hard for me to believe that there was a time where United States citizens did not consume as much as we do today. It feels like it has always been a part of the culture. After reading Vance Packward’s, The Waste Makers, I am in shock that the idea of just buying because you can instead of buying what you need was pushed. That is money that could be saved every year that could go towards something more rewarding like a retirement fund. It was such a crazy transformation because you all of sudden have people buying more and more due to companies reinforcing the idea you needed to buy multiple items of the same product. For example, the “two-house family,” where companies advertise to people on the idea that your home needed two cars, three to four bathrooms, two fully-furnished kitchens, two to four television sets, and much more. It is mind-boggling to see this rapid transformation and it eventually became the new cultural norm in the United States. 

          <br><br>

Our way of consumption seems to only be getting worse and I feel like this is a problem that has been put on by the companies themselves. Yes, consumers play a role because they are the ones who keep buying the products, but it is the advertisements by the companies that continue this cycle because everyone (including me) feels like I need to buy the next best thing. We buy an item, use it for a little bit until it gets old, then we dispose of it just to buy another product. This cycle is continuing to create waste and it does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon because of consumer culture. Other countries look at us and think that we have so much stuff to the point that it is enormous in numbers. Companies need to stop advertising so much and the consumer should be more conscious of what you buy and make purchases that are more worthwhile.

Although all of the information from the few chapters read in the "waste makers" wasn't all that surprising it did reassure to me just how manipulative corporate companies are in order to maximize their sales and to continuously keep profiting off consumers. Companies plan out ways to brainwash customers in order to get them to consistently come into their stores and stay in them for as long as possible. This fits into the concept of planned obsolescence that the author kept building on and explaining. It's essentially the main points that companies need to achieve in order to keep customers coming back pertaining to the objective of making all of their current products become obsolete in the near future. They do this by making products undesirable through the release of multiple different seasons or waves of new products and even through making products simply not lasting longer than a few months after the new version pf it is released. It is a very strategic business model that has proven great success however its not only taking advantage of consumers, it is, more importantly, taking a toll on the environment.  With constant new products being released and low pricing to get more and more products out the door, production has grown exponentially as this "consumer culture" has been adapted. Factories are pumping out more greenhouse gases than ever before and consumers are throwing away products more than ever before.

          <br><br>

With this business plan of "Fast fashion" or "Fast tech", consumers are addicted to getting the new version of every good and as soon as they get the new good the old one is thrown away serving as a waste, making the production of it not at all worth it as the lifespan of goods that should last up to 4 years are now being disposed of months after the are bought. Whether it is the corporate or consumers' fault for adopting this way of fast purchasing and living is hard to say, but the consumers do have the choice to protest against this system by not participating in it anymore and swaying companies to better fit our needs so they can once again become more profitable. This was a great article and has reassured my belief in moving our consumer culture into one that values quality over quantity.

<p>

Something I found really interesting form the reading was how many of the item we buy are designed to be thrown away pre maturely, or are too much of a hassle to dispose of properly. For example the author writes, "millions of 'used' tubes of lipstick are thrown away with a half inch of lipstick remaining in the tube because the mechanism will not bring up all the lipstick".  There are many examples of this that I can think of, such as tooth paste, fast fashion clothes, and even expensive apple products.  It is not hidden knowledge that corporations do not create high quality products, or create deteriorating products, because it means they will sell more.  While on an individual scale it seems small, its not just one of your shirts that ripped, that same shirt has ripped for millions of other people as well, all of which will end up in a landfill after very limited use.  It also requires a ton of water, energy, time, and transportation to make billions of goods that will be discarded in a few years adding to the detriment to the environment.

I think this book is really interesting, because it let me realize that I was influenced by those smart enterprise deeply. They show me good advertisement and attract me to upload products in my home. However, many things in my home are still useful and well- functioned. There is no need to change or even throw out them, but I want to buy the latest one. Now. I realize that this is completely wrong behaviors. For those things that can be kept using, I will never convert them so quickly. This is aiming to protect environment and decrease the amount of carbon dioxide released by producing goods.

Corporations and consumerism definitely have their drawbacks, and this video made me consider them more deeply. As mentioned in this video, what the tobacco industry did (and continues to do) is terrible. It is knowingly selling people something that will shorten their lifespan. And yes, they target children in their advertising to hopefully convert them into lifelong smokers. Back then, not everyone knew that smoking is bad but today, everyone knows it's bad. Why then, do people continue buying cigarettes?
          <br><br>
 I honestly don't know, but I think there will always be a market for them, and banning them would just lead to an unregulated black market. 
          <br><br>

This is one of the drawbacks of capitalism. In general, if unregulated, it can lead to the suffering and potentially, death of many people. This is why we have many regulatory systems today that try to mitigate this kind of thing from happening.

The “Wastemakeers” talks about people consuming fueling for contentment. Me, personally really disagree with this action. And the consumerism has become an important environmental problem. First of all, the industry waste added thousand of waste on the earth. For a long time, especially during the Great Depression, people had suffered a time period that they cannot afford food, milk, and cloths. Hence, when the U.S Economy turns normal, people started to buy a lot of things for contentment. Because people are afraid of being lacked. 
          <br><br>
And in the video, Ken list another example of the automobile to show that more and more people start to be consumerism, which will increase waste on the earth. In my opinion, consumerism means that people feel uncontented about their currently life. It is true that people reserve their right of chasing happiness. But happiness should not base of the waste of earth.

I agree, consumerism has become a big environmental problem, as well as a cultural one. Culturally imbedded within our society, consumerism shapes every aspect of our lives. Everywhere we go and everything we do; we are constantly being bombarded by advertisements. American culture has consistently been reliant on getting the things we want fast, cheap, and easy. This mindset for convenience has enabled our society to always want more because of how easily we can obtain the things we desire. Additionally, I agree with Ken’s statement about how the automobile industry enhances consumerism by making new cars more frequently. As a result, the things we get are shortly thrown away and replaced by the newest commodity, thus leaving our planet covered in our material waste. I also agree with your comment about consumerism being connected to the happiness to one’s life being unfulfilled, I find great similarity between this and the Walden piece we read last week. I think material happiness is a false reality that consumeristic culture created for us to continue to buy more. We need to remind ourselves the importance of the simple life Walden hoped for.

In direct response to Ken’s question, I think that both consumers and the companies who manufacture “stuff” are responsible for our obsession with consumer goods. After reading “The Wastemakers,” it is clear that there is some major manipulation going on by producers to essentially create a market for a good that isn’t really necessary, but I don’t think this completely leaves consumers innocent. I feel this way because even in the post-WWII era (not just now) when consumerism really began to rise, I can’t imagine humans not having some sort of guilty conscience for all the things that they wasted or consumed. To SOME degree, people had to have been aware of how much they were using. They may not have seen it from an ecological standpoint, but from an economic one wouldn’t they very clearly be able to see how much it hurt their wallets? Maybe I’m too optimistic that people have good consciences at the end of the day, but that’s just how I like to view the world. 
          <br><br>
Anyways, I really feel like I learned a lot from “The Waste Makers” regarding examples of tactics companies would use to continue profiting, as well as a lot about the concept of obsolescence. Mainly that companies use the obsolescence of quality and desirability to either create products designed to have a certain lifespan- meaning consumers would be forced to purchase another, or how they would manipulate the concept of “style” and rotate new ideas in and out. I also want to mention that I liked how Ken brought up the smoking example in his lecture since that wasn’t addressed in the reading. The reading examples like women’s hemlines in clothing or car production were still intriguing, but Ken’s focus on the deathly effects of smoking really showcases how far companies are willing to go to continue profiting. Even as he said, off of millions that they are killing. Overall, although long, this was an informative reading that taught me quite a bit.

After reading The Waste Makers, I was extremely disappointed in the US and its consumer culture after I realized how it all came to be. When reading older stories, I would often hear about the family heirloom-like a watch-that would be passed down for generations, or fountain pens that would be used for a lifetime. I remembered thinking about how much sentimental value each of these items must’ve had to its owners. Like Packard mentioned in his book, most objects are no longer seen that way. Instead, they are seen as easily disposable. Instead of taking pride in the history or durable antiquity of an objects, owning something for a long time has become a source of shame. Consumerism culture has manipulated us to feel like we must always keep up with the trends in order to stay relevant. As much as corporations are responsible for the creation of this toxic culture, not all the blame falls on them. Like Packard mentioned, we enabled their behavior. They would not have been successful if we were already satisfied with what we had and did not always desire for better and more. For example, women used fashion trends in order to justify buying a new dress every season although their previous dresses were still functional and sufficed. 
          <br><br>
This materialistic culture has become ingrained in American culture. However, after reading this book, I am actually more optimistic that we can revert back to our previous, more environmentally conscious culture. After all, if companies were able to culture such an environment for their benefit in just a couple decades, then there is definitely hope that the reverse is possible.

After reading "The Waste Makers", I was much better informed about the marketing strategies companies use to maximize profits and strictly benefit themselves. In chapter 5, they talk about how in earlier times, Americans preserved their valuables for as long as they could. They would use the over and over gain until it was no longer possible. Nowadays, we get "bored" of a certain thing and immediately buy another and another. At the end of the day, for example, fashion companies have specific strategies to persuade consumers to buy more and more. It is the same with other industries like the tobacco industry.
          <br><br>

One example that shocked me used by our professor was the Joe Camel commercial. After learning that smoking can lead to earlier death and its negative effects, the tobacco industry didn't stop and instead re-strategized in order to continue profits. They released the Joe Commercial in order to introduce new cigarettes. The shocking part is that they were also targeting minors with these commercials. A fact that shocked me was that the Camel became as popular to minors as Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is known by people all over the world so when it is compared to a cigarette commercial is hard to hear. This just shows how evil the tobacco industry can be in order to maximize profits.

This book was an interesting read with a lot of points I could go on about. However, two main ideas I want to question are saturation and the three pillars of planned obsolescence. As the first couple chapters explain and discuss the market’s “problem” of keeping sales and consumerism growing in the then current “mounting saturation,” and therefore the tactics marketers use to combat this issue like “more-sales-through-matching” “there’s-a-different-color-for-every-room," "double ring" wedding ceremony,” “two-or-more-of-a-kind,” "forced consumption,” "more car per car," "the equations [being] fixed: small equals cheap equals bad, and large equals expensive equals good,” it makes sense as to why there is such a dominant culture of wasteful consumerism here in the United States and why, as we even exemplified in class yesterday, minimalism seems difficult for some to consider. Similar to, but not as grave as Ken’s example to the strategies employed by the tobacco industry, if corporations know that they are feeding into a harmful cycle of inducing consumers to “newer and better products they need,” discarding, destroying and wasting that produces profit at the cost of deceit and environmental harm, why are we allowing this behavior to continue and remain unchecked? I think the best way to combat this phenomena of “register-tingling regularity” lies in cultural change. 
          <br><br>
Just as planned obsolescence was seeded into our culture for organized waste by corporations, I know that we can improve consumerism strategies by learning about and recognizing obsolescence of quality and desire. I have definitely been practicing this more since I came to college and have no choice but to budget myself, and I have seen people that do not budget but buy into the ideas of obsolescence sold by marketing companies. It makes me upset to read about the lengths corporations and marketing companies go to in the name of the “oh-so-American” values of capitalism, when they are really harming people in the United States and the land itself.

After reading the chapters, it came apparent to me how we as a country have seen the problem for decades, yet we didn’t act. As stated in the book, this is due to years and years of manipulation from industries and corporations. 
          <br><br>

When I see the problem, many activities and students try to point fingers solely at these corporations and industries. In the video, when Ken was talking about how the tobacco industry targeted children, he noted that if left ‘unchecked’ corporations will do extraordinary things for profit. When he said this, it really made me think, who actually keeps the massive corporations in check? The way I see it, we shouldn’t be blaming the industries that want our money, we should be blaming our government. The government should be an institution that needs to be able to recognize and inhibit corporations from doing these sinister advertising campaigns; clearly almost every citizen could see the example Ken gave us as a malicious and ill-boding campaign that these companies inflict on the population.

I find it strikingly profound, in an age where rents and student tuitions and healthcare expenses are exploding ever further out of reach for most Americans, that the past was so...optimistic about the potential for growth, that the American manufacturing jobs would always be there and that Detroit would always get to set the agenda because it was American. This consumerist culture in the modern era strikes me as similar to an offhand comment I once read about the period during the collapse of the Soviet Union: "luxuries are cheap and necessities are unaffordable".

Both of my parents are immigrants to the U.S.; my dad’s family from England and my mom’s from Nicaragua. Over time my mom has told me how different it was coming here from her country, and today I FaceTime my grandma, currently living in France, and she is openly critical of American culture. Since I have only grown up familiar with American consumer culture, it is disappointing to realize my tendencies have always been rooted in consumerism. 
          <br><br>
My mom was only 4 when she emigrated from Nicaragua, but she never fails to remind me that she had about 2 outfits and one pair of shoes growing up. My grandpa grew up as well with one pair of girl’s shoes that didn’t fit him because they couldn’t afford to buy multiple pairs of new shoes once his were no longer wearable. Of course these examples are a result of a family in poverty in a poor country, but it is also telling of how, in contrast, American culture is indulgent. If we can buy another pair of shoes we will. Maybe our shoes are out of style or don’t match with the outfit we want to wear out, but this is such a privileged mindset created by rapacious corporations. “Waste Makers” explains this well with the “more-sales-through-matching” concept. Companies advertise so many different colors and varieties of the same item, and it is so ingrained in the American mind that we must buy each version to “match” in any situation. Even if we don’t plan on using the thing soon, we need it just in case. Unlike how my mom and her family grew up using everything they owned in its full lifespan, Americans will keep buying as new products come out. “Outdated” products are obsolete despite having years of practical use because of the timely manner that companies release “new & improved” items.  
          <br><br>
My English grandma lives simply in the countryside of France and never fails to criticize my dad for his excessive spending habits and wastefulness. She asks him why it is necessary for a family of 4 to have a 6 bedroom house, and why he would need an expensive car that just sits in the driveway (both situations adding immensely to his and my carbon footprint). He has no justification for it, because there is none. American corporations have taught him and many other upper-middle-class families that they need excess. The only reason being that if you can, you should. In comparison, my grandma has a small ranch home with lots of land, and she hardly shops at all because any shopping centers are far from their home and they don’t own a car. We have two very different versions of a middle class lifestyle, all because American corporations have focused their efforts on creating a “brand new breed of super customers.” Since the ‘50s we have eaten up advertisement after advertisement and now it has become increasingly easy to surrender to the habits of wasteful consumerism. 
          <br><br>
In the end I think that American society has been led into a constant state of buying and it would be very difficult to try and go back from these tendencies. It is discomforting to think that Americans are at the whim of corporations and their marketing skills. What is worse is that while we are so caught up in our new things, a byproduct of this unhealthy culture is our dying earth. Consumer culture fuels CO2 emissions. Our money goes directly to car companies, fast fashion, and massive homes. In our contrived quest to have more, we only end up with less than we started with.

Consumption is at a rise and it has been for the past few decades, many industries such as the automobile industry and the fashion industry are creating more and more demand for their products by creating new and improved products faster. As a society we are prone to keep with trends, every time a new product comes out we discard the old one and purchase the new one. Therefore, we are only keeping a item for a fraction of the time it could be used, this increased our carbon footprint, not only by increasing our waste but also by increasing the energy required to make new products. Reading “The waste maker” made me come to the conclusion that consumerism is constantly trying to make us unsatisfied with the products we own and encourages us to buy the supposedly newer, better product. The turn over rate for clothes and cars is only a tiny fraction of what it used to be. If we kept our clothes until they ripped instead of throwing them away as soon as it is out of style, we could drastically reduce our carbon footprint. Ken’s explanation of the tobacco industry using children to get them addicted to cigarettes, which would kill them 10 years earlier on average is appalling. The fact that oil companies are trying to extract and sell as much oil as they can and make as much profit as they can knowingly killing thousands of species per year, and endangering billions of people from the natural disasters we are experiencing as a result of climate change. Industries are endangering our planet and all its inhabitants solely because of profit. However, this only works if the demand matches the supply, therefore we should consider our own actions, consume less, reuse more, and use products longer so companies make less products.

After reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I am even more amazed at the number of consumerist messages that surround us in our daily life. I had assumed that consumerism had only grown in the past 30 years, but the fact that this book was written in 1960, and compiled with data and facts prior to 1960, the influence of consumerism is exponentially bigger than I had thought. I understand that the trend of credit and mass purchasing and materialism mainly started in the 1950s, post-WII. So, if Packard had thought that consumerism was a negative and damaging thing back in the 1960s, I can't imagine what he would think of it now.
          <br><br>
The three obsolescence that Packard names: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, obsolescence of desirability is extremely obvious and relevant now, that each one is integrated into all the material things we own. Our phones themselves represent all three obsolescence, where the average lifespan is around 2 years for the battery, and its abilities are constantly being updated for consumers to think that they need a device with "better" qualities. New phones released each year also increase our desirability for newer phones each year. 
          <br><br>
Therefore, I think Packard does a great job in unpacking all the mechanisms behind mass consumption, that we cannot blame only the consumers themselves in giving into temptation to buy and own stuff, but instead we also need to realize the multiple inner workings behind the scenes. These marketing, advertising, and producing strategies are big reasons why we demand and consume more.

To be honest, it takes me a long time to figure out what is the stance of the author. When I first started reading, I kind of feel like this is a passage teaching the merchant and marketing managers how to win more consumers, or how to deal with their mass inventories of unsold products. However, as I approached more to the argument, it is becoming clearer. The author is anti-consumerism and his attitude can be interpreted through the anecdotes attached. For the strategies that he listed, I want to talk about something that really strikes me. For example, in chapter4 he discussed how merchants try to create different plausible excuses and induce consumers to buy more of their products. There are things that really pissed me off. “The way to end glut was to produce gluttons.” or “HOME MEANS MORE WITH CARPET ON THE FLOOR.” What exasperated me is the fact that I do fall in their traps by trusting such stupid and seems-to-be unlogical words. And the example of Revlon strongly caught me cuz before reading this, I still deeply believe that different nail enamels should cope with different outfits or feelings! Thus, rather than viewing this article as a marketing strategy guide, I surely believe this is an exposure of the dark truths and tricks played by the merchants. And I hope more people can see these truths through the mist created by businessmen and stop doing wasteful consumptions.


<br><hr>
I think Packard would be disturbed by our excessive growth of consumerism but not very surprised. He had already realized the US government would encourage people to buy anything and everything just for the sake of the economy. Similarly, I also instantly thought of our smartphones when Packard was discussing the three obsolescence. Especially Apple with the “new” iPhones they introduce every year. Apple claims they are “new and improved” and list all the qualities that make the phone better and makes people stand in long lines to buy although they have a phone that works. 
          <br><br>

Although he wrote this decades ago, a majority still stands true today. He said, “nearly two-fifths of the things he [American consumers] owns are things that are not essential to his physical well-being”. Very accurate, a lot of the things that we have are unnecessary because we may buy them when sad, happy, etc. It can even be due to the profound culture that Prof. Hiltner talks about because we have celebrities like Arianna Grande with hit songs like 7 Rings referring to shopping as a form of therapy for those who can afford it. If celebrities people admire are saying “if you want it, just buy it” or their government telling them it's their “patriotic duty” to buy more things people will continue mass shopping without feeling an ounce of guilt. Packard’s comment about the stores having too much reminded me of when I worked retail, every Tuesday we would get more than a hundred boxes to “restock” the store even though it was filled to the max already. My hope would be for people to stop buying things that are not necessary so these companies would stop wasting money and resources creating so much merchandise. That hope flies out the window on weekends when people are ‘treating themselves’ to things they don’t need.

I agree with your comment. I too did not realize this article came out in 1960, long before items such as iPhones and Xboxs came out. It is frightening to think that companies have been playing mind games on  consumers for such a long time. Like you said, the iPhone seems to be a prime example of this issue today. Apple makes sure to release a new version every single year. It may only have a few tweaks or changes, but they are certain that the moment it drops people will swarm to buy them. In reality, we do not need these things. An iPhone 8 works just as well as the iPhone 10, albeit with slightly slower speeds and maybe a slightly worse camera. The issue is that even though people are aware of this, they will not stop falling for the ploy. I fear that we are too deep in consumerism for this issue to truly stop, and the more we feed into it, the worse off our planet will be.

Upon reading "The Waste Makers" I too was a little surprised by the number of consumerist messages that are presented on a daily basis, but it honestly should not come as a surprise. Compared to the amount of consumerist messages that were being spread in the 1960s I believe that it should have not shocked me to know that it has been growing exponentially since then. I too found it interesting to think about what Packard would think about the levels of consumerism now, after seeing how the world and society has improved but also worsened since he made those comments. 
          <br><br>
The part of your comment that you brought up with the phones was very insightful and true extremely true. I think that the three obsolescence that Packard brought up should be looked at more seriously because his insight about people always wanting to improve their property has only been shown to be more and more evident in todays consumerism and materialistic society. 
          <br><br>
Finally, I think that your closing statement was very well stated and Packards insights were very revealing of where society was heading. I think that there inner workings of society and our consumerist society have much deeper links than the things you mentioned, such as marketing and advertising, and that it will be interesting to see how this continues to affect our future society.

Because of the needs of one of my courses, I just wrote a comparison of Apple's advertisements to prove how they attract consumers. At first, I thought that Apple just takes advantage of the American dream, such as people care about social status, to allure consumers. After reading this article and your comments, I realized that what I wrote was not enough. The three strategies definitely impose negative effects on judging.
          <br><br>
I admire the author very much. In such a rapidly developing society, he could still stick to his heart, not be lured by other desires, and use words as a weapon to wake up “sleeping” people. However, since someone can do this, whether to blame consumers or external advertisements still needs to be discussed.
          <br><br>
 Here's a joke (no offensive).

<br><hr>
I completely  agree with your comment. It, too, shocked me after reading "The Waste Makers" how prevalent the agendas of companies that push the consumerism culture are in our society now and in the past. I never put much thought into all of the various forms of advertisement and marketing that have been shoved in our faces and targeted toward us until I got old enough and wise enough to question it. It kind of scares me to fathom how much power and influence such strategies have on our thoughts and actions. I think mentioning how our phones are prime examples of how products can be seen as obsolescent is very telling of the power they have over our decisions. It has gotten to the point that we are convinced Apple "slows down" our phones right before they launch a new product to force us to buy it. While this may hold some truth, I have had the same iPhone for almost three years and it is doing me just fine. Will I probably buy a new one at the next upgrade? Yes. Do I really need it in terms of functionality and performance? No. This form of obsolescence- desirability- is the greatest and most dangerous in my opinion. If you can move people to buy more simply because of stylistic changes... that is a game changer. It sounds crazy and it is easy to believe that you are exempt from such manipulation, but we all give into these temptations. I believe it is really on the hands of these companies that made consumers how they are. It has been their life mission to make us believe that our consumer/materialistic culture is normal and right. It is hard if uneducated about these topics to understand the negative effects of our culture especially when it is being forced down our throats. They painted being wasteful, something that seems so obviously bad, as a great and innovative idea. Like what? These people go to great lengths to push their agendas, and it makes it even harder for me to believe that we can shift American perspective of the consumerism and materialistic culture we live in.

I agree with a number of things you’ve mentioned in your comment. I found it surprising that even back in the 1960’s, companies were already pushing for rampant consumerism for selfish reasons. I have always considered rampant consumerism to be a relatively modern problem, so it surprised me to see that there were already people like Packard who were worried about the consequences even back in the 1960’s. I was also very shocked by the large influence consumerism and advertisement had on people’s daily lives back then. The mindset back then was very similar to the one we have now. I’m surprised that after all this time of worrying about the consequences of such rampant consumerism, it is not a problem that is commonly spoken about, and not many have made changes to their daily lives to combat it. 
           <br><br>
I like how you summarized the three obsolescences (obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability) because those are really the main points that Packard mentions about marketing tactics that lead to consumerism. I find it, in a way, fascinating and horrifying how large companies were (and still are) able to manipulate so many people into buying products that they do not need. I like your analogy about our phones. Whenever a new model of a phone (namely iphones) hits the market, people scramble to purchase the new phone because it is trendy and desirable even if their old phone still works perfectly fine. I found this trend to be highly wasteful even before taking this class and learning about consumerism. Now, after reading Packard’s book and taking this class, I have learned that this is also very detrimental to the environment and it should be a habit we learn to fix.

This book truly made me realize how much effort is put into trying to get Americans to buy more and more things. I am personally guilty of this, as I take any chance I get to go shopping and buy new things. Especially with malls, I feel like it’s so easy to be tempted to give into consumer culture. We’re always presented with new things and the way that what’s “in” and “out” of style changes so frequently makes it clear how much consumer culture has an effect on us. We’re always waiting for the next best thing and trying to always stay in style, but it’s actually so harmful to our environment and that’s what we fail to realize. Our consumer culture has a way of keeping things so fast paced that once a new thing gets popular or stylish, it only lasts for a bit. Most trends last for a bit and then they go away after a few months. 

          <br><br>

I found it very interesting how in the book, the author says “newness as a trait is cherished”. It really shows how industrial machines feed off of our want for new things in order to advance themselves. I think it’s corrupt that they would take advantage of us in that way but also it’s our fault for giving into it. The rate at which Americans consume and then get rid of things is alarming, and the fact that we are so accustomed to this is so bad. Our culture is so obsessed with getting what’s new and exciting that we forget about the harmful effects the industry has on our environment. I think this definitely ties back into the Thoreau reading, as we should all try to live more minimalistic lives rather than consume so much. It’s hard when we are so used to this lifestyle and when the economy thrives off of our rapid consumerism but I believe that little by little we can implement change.

The reading for this week which is called The Waste Makers was a very interesting reading. This reading made me more aware of things like the death rate of an item. I knew that the death rate so to speak of an item was limited. There is nothing that is electronically that I could think of without an expiration date. The fact that there is companies and industry than make items less efficient for the sole reason of only getting money is so unrealistic. But it is the reality of the economy is that we currently live in today. Everything is about making money off whatever anyone can. Profit it is what people are looking for in this economy. Companies rather make sure their product has an expiration date to make sure that people will continue to buy the item. Or another thing is that companies will come out with a “better “And “newer” version of an item. Like the example with the light bulbs. It doesn’t make sense to me. If I am going to make something, I would want it to last as long as it can. This consumerism culture has been here for a while and has only grown to the problem that we see today. For Example, for recent days it would be like the phones but specifically the infamous iPhones. Like the newest version of the phone has so many cameras.

After reading the "waste makers", I see how impressionable I've been and how much I've contributed to an economy based around waste. When I was little I begged my parents for the new Nintendo device every time a new one came out, now they just sit in the drawers of my old house never to be used again. The same goes for clothing. What's interesting is how normalized our waste has become. I knew that consumer culture was bad, unethical and manipulative, but I grew accustomed to the idea that it somehow made me feel better. 
          <br><br>


Being surrounded by consumerism for my whole life, it seems frighteningly normal to me. When I first visited my little cousins in Mexico I saw that they didn't buy a lot of things, they didn't have a phone to play with, or hundreds of barbie dolls like I did as a girl, but what separated them from me was how happy they looked if they could just go outside and run or play with their chickens. They didn't need the stimulation that American children needed to be entertained and content. The waste makers puts American consumerism in perspective. Yes, consumer culture is now a global issue that plagues much of the developed world, but based on the reading, I can see how the U.S. has poisoned a world into believing the idea that somehow buying more and more stuff will make ones life better. What scared me most about the reading is how much corporations have manipulated consumers, and how many of these consumers are young children. I used to believe that we were the problem, that corporations would stop propagating useless stuff if we stopped buying it, but I've come to realize how wrong I am. Yes, we should play our part and stop buying things but corporations continue to manipulate consumer for their sole benefit.

I really like the point you made about American children needing stimulation for entertainment through the consumerist culture. Your story about visiting your cousins even made me think about how normal having "things" is to me. I too would always beg for the newest device, and would always ask my mom to go shopping because I was embarrassed that my clothes were going out of style. I wanted to shop and specific brands because the clothes from specific brands that I had were no longer cool. I'm glad that I was not the only one to realise the magnitude of this problem, and believe that while we everyday consumers can make a choice to purchase less, that doesn't mean that these big, greedy corporations will stop trying to manipulate us. I understand how after the second world war, America needed this economic stimulation, and turned to this consumerism in order to create a sense of unity after a trying time, but there has to be other ways in which economic growth can occur without completely destroying this earth with waste.

Reading "The Waste Makers" was really relieving, especially the part that companies make their products to break and have a shorter use so that people can continue to buy their products. Companies do not care that by making these products over and over again only increases the CO2 emissions that were used to make it. They make their products to break and wear out on purpose so that we the consumers can just spend more money and continue to allow these companies to grow. However, companies are not the only ones to blame, society today encourages these actions by over-consuming. We encourage these companies to make products that wouldn't last long because they know that we just buy-in and continue to consume. Nowadays, people buy products and use them once and get rid of them before they even become unusable. But with people's mindset of using something once and then discarding it will only negatively impact the environment. Buy over-consuming we are allowing companies to make more products and allowing them to pump more CO2 into the atmosphere. With companies making cheap products with a shorter life span and people over-consuming is destroying the planet.

After reading the chapters in the book, I can see the writer Vance Packard clearly “foresees” the future situation of cultural shift, well, it has already happened at that time. So, it would not be that surprising that we made the mistakes what our parent generation did several decades ago again. You know, people are learning the behavior fast when it is relatively bad even though they know the fact. So as consuming. I am not saying that every American learns to consume but mostly lots of people get the concept of consuming when they are young. The advertisements would be significant way to influence the young children as their potential consumers. 
           <br><br>

That is pretty sick for me when I realize that the consuming ideas was came from the advertisements that I remembered it fairly clear as now. Those companies put their profit at the first place instead of consumers’ real need. The cigarette example gets me touched by the attitude of cigarette companies. I feel scared like never before. Other companies that chasing the fashion or popular trend cannot compare to cigarette companies. They are less cruel than murder people. That fact makes me cringing and shaking. If nothing can stop them denying the truth of cigarette with career, people are never learning the lesson from the coax from big companies.

Within the reading there was an interesting concept brought up called “planned obsolescence,” which I wasn’t familiar with. There are three different types: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability. For obsolescence of function, this is when a different product is introduced that can perform its function better than a product you have. From my personal observation, I’ve seen this occur often in kitchen appliances and cooking appliances. As for obsolescence of quality, this is a planned design for a product to break down and wear out over time, usually not too distant. Although this is not quite the same my friend and I have a conspiracy theory that Apple might do this with their iphones. Personally, we have seen our phones reduce in quality, usually getting slower or all of a sudden not working as well when Apple releases a newer iPhone version. However, none of this is confirmed and this may have just been a coincidence. As for obsolescence of desirability, the product becomes worn out in our minds because a styling or other change makes it seems less desirable. Now this for sure happens when it comes to phones especially with the brands Apple and Samsung. These brands are always releasing new versions with slightly different features, making you feel the need to get the new version and that the one you have is worn out even though the newer version is barely different than the one you have. Because of this type of mindset, people tend to give in and buy the newer version of the phone, while the version they used before it sits around and goes to waste. It is important to note that waste is not only things you typically put in the trash can, but there’s this thing called e-waste that is bad for the planet. Fortunately people have tried to fix this problem by setting up EcoAtms in places such as walmart. At an EcoAtm you can get money for your older generations of phones. When the EcoAtm buys the phone from you, it will recycle the phone, and even if you end up getting offered no money but allow the machine to have it, the phone will still be recycled. It is important to know that you are able to give the phone to the machine to recycle no matter the condition it is in. I would highly suggest if no one is going to use the phone to give the phone to the machine to be recycled even if you are not offered money. After all, it is convenient and eco friendly. I hope if any of you guys have any phones that are currently just collecting dust that you look into this. Please let me know if you know of any similar companies that have this level of covencience and help the planet.

I also found the chapter on planned obsolescence very interesting as well, and I agree with the idea you mentioned about apple products being created to slow down when the new version comes out. I have experienced this with my Apple products as well, and it’s definitely a selling tactic these and many other companies have to keep customers coming back. I was recently at the mall in LA the other day and observed how many people were at the Apple store, buying items or doing their regular upgrade. I find it truly ridiculous to be upgrading and item when it’s still in near perfect condition, simply for having the most up to date item. I really appreciate that you bring up the problem of e-waste, as this is a major problem, not just for the environment, but also for human rights and environmental justice issues. I think it’s great that we are starting to see these EcoATMs and e-waste recycling, however it is important to see if this waste is actually being recycled in proper recycling facilities capable of properly disposing of many toxic waste chemicals from our electronics. I think this is definitely a big step in the right direction because waste management is a big issue, but I hope they are properly disposing of the e-waste in proper facilities, not just sending it to the global south where it will get recycled in very hazardous ways that usually end up lethally contaminating the groundwater, air, and soil. Recycling, whether it’s textiles, or e-waste, usually has a very toxic trail along with it, so as although we may think we’re doing the right thing recycling, often times it’s not actually recycled in an ethical way.

In the book "The Waste Makers", it illustrates how companies are trying to upscale their sales. The problem with this is that this creates consumers, and as Ken stated in the video, the essence of that word is that people consume and then create waste. This vast amount of waste is building up and ultimately harming the environment. 

           <br><br>

I was shocked to see how greedy companies can be, which is shown when the book provides insight on labor leader Walter Reuther. He complained how the US lost nearly 100 billion dollars worth of merchandise because they didn't maximize their productive capacity. He was essentially complaining at how companies didn't flood the market with items that aren't necessities and would then become trash. How ignorant must one be?
           <br><br>


I find it somewhat sad how we must constantly consume in order for society to be functioning. What really stuck out to me was when President Eisenhower was asked how can the people help to end a recession. His response truly captivates the economy of the United States, "Buy... Anything".

Recycling, whether it’s textiles, or e-waste, usually has a very toxic trail along with it, so as although we may think we’re doing the right thing recycling, often times it’s not actually recycled in an ethical way.

In my country, Brazil, literally everything you buy, even a cheap meal, can be paid in installments. This is a good thing because it means that people who make minimum wage are able to buy the things they need, such as refrigerators, cellphones, food, etc. But it’s also a bad thing because it tricks people into thinking that they have money and that they should spend it whenever they want since the payments are spread out. This made people feel comfortable with buying 2 of each, especially people who grew up poor and managed to ascend to the upper-middle-class since they learned to value physical things more.

           <br><br>

When I was growing up, we had a refrigerator in the kitchen and one close to our barbecue area since it was more convenient to entertain guests and serve them drinks there, instead of having to climb 10 steps to get to the kitchen. We were spending a lot more energy, putting a lot more pollution in the environment, for the convenience of not having to walk another 10ft. Today, this is a completely absurd concept to me, especially since over 1 million homes don’t have access to electricity and 35 million don’t have access to drinking water in my country; yet the middle class is still concerned about having a fridge 5ft from the dining table they use twice a year.

Wow, I never thought of paying in installments for common stuff! I think buying a dress in installments might have been mentioned once in children's book I read. It's just that fictional. Yet, it makes sense to me that houses and cars are paid in installments. I find it interesting that our culture affects how people shop. My mom will buy the lamest bracelet because it's for some cultural reason. Personally, I feel that if I made a similar bracelet and gave it to her (the bracelet was fifty bucks but I bet I could've made one), it would be worth a lot more. 
           <br><br>

Paying it entirely is also kinda bad because people will see something and feel that they have enough money to buy it, buy it, use it, and forget about it. Since they've already paid, there's no point to remember the product once they've used it. I feel that paying in installments reminds people about the product, since they'll see that they're still paying for it. Of course, I might be wrong since I've never experienced paying in installments. 
           <br><br>

Also, I feel you with the refrigerator. My family moved our fridge downstairs from the kitchen, and it is such a pain to even get a glass of milk. Every time I go down to the fridge, I grumble about it in my mind. Yet, I also don't ask my parents to move the fridge back up to the kitchen because there's nothing wrong with walking a few extra feet and going down and up a few steps. Every time I see someone complain out of laziness about getting out of bed to get something that's three feet away, I feel annoyed for the same reasons. It's even more annoying when people are doing extra damage to the environment for dumb reasons. I understand that everyone has a carbon footprint, and that some people might have large ones. It's extremely frustrating when people add to their carbon emissions for reasons that could be completely avoided or at least alleviated. Walking a few extra steps is probably good for the health.

After finishing this reading material, I was surprised by the methods of the waste makers, they used every single way to persuade people to purchase things from them no matter they need it or not. In this way, the entire US economy would increase dramatically and nobody cares that what kind of pollution it can cause for our environment. For example, many American, German, British companies bought the copyright of the products, but they choose to manufacture those products in some cheap labor countries like China, India, Indonesia, Laos...They should consider that those cheap labor countries share the same earth with them. And every year they purchase and order more than they need, they trash those products which have short preserve time and sell it back to those cheap labor countries. I viewed the data that America sells hundreds and thousands tons of trash. Those cheap labor countries have limited power to deal with those trash but at the same time they must use some parts of those trash to make their life better. The Apple company create a model of phone every other year, and I think their performance is pretty same like. They build the parts and assemble in China. That costs tons of pollution in China. That's why it's hard to say who is the real waste producer.

It seems like every single aspect of the consumer culture was meant to intentionally do as much environmental harm as is humanly possible. Like consumption and production is bad but they literally encouraged you to waste as much as possible. I found this truly shocking. Initially, I assumed that waste was just an unfortunate byproduct of a powerful economy, but its sickening to learn that it is deliberate. “The new mood of the disposable era was reflected in the pages of the Engineering News Record, which observed: "Nowhere in the world except in the U.S. would a skyscraper office building in sound condition be torn down merely to be replaced by another one." The effects of this waste mentality stretch even farther than just the environment. As the paper points out, “The average United States family today spends five hundred dollars of its income each year just for the package” meaning even from a consumer perspective this transition to disposability was not in our best interest. And secondly, the movement towards “Easy to make” food products has disastrous health effects. The types of preservatives in prepackaged food are consistently shown to be linked to cancer and other ailments.
           <br><br>

On a separate note, I was disgusted to learn that marketers from the Holland Furnace Company would pretend to be government inspectors so they could convince people they needed a replacement furnace if they didn’t want to risk fires. Although increasing demand for furnaces, it is unbelievable from an ethics standpoint. Although Holland was a clear example of forcing consumers to buy replacements, the idea of “planned obsolescence” was a more indirect method of getting the public to continuously buy a product. An ethical approach to this would be too constantly innovate the product and thus consumers will purchase it in order to better their own lives. However, from a business standpoint it is much cheaper to simply make the products so that they have a predetermined“death date” where the product will be unusable. In this way, rather than encouraging the consumer to buy the better product, they are essentially forced to keep buying replacements everytime their product breaks. This puts an unnecessary strain on families who often have trouble affording replacements. All of this...for corporate greed. 
           <br><br>

In response to these accusations, Safford made a decent point that they need consumers to keep buying products continuously so that they can have the funds necessary to do real innovation. However, I highly doubt there is a separate set of engineers in a company who are specifically tasked with obsolescence and then an engineering force tasked with making true innovations. In all likelihood, the amount of time devoted to profitability far outweighs the time and money spent on genuine attempts at innovation.

I agree with you; it is astonishing how American consumerism culture has evolved into a waste making machine. As Packard bluntly put it, American’s are turning “... into voracious, wasteful, compulsive consumers' '. It is astonishing how we have been trained to mindlessly consume and then quickly discard. This mindset is an inherent part of our economy. For decades “the United States economy [has depended on] the willingness of consumers and the government to spend more each year than they have the preceding year”. 
           <br><br>


I found it incredibly disheartening when Packard described various ways corporations deceive people into purchasing more of their products. One of these tactics is to encourage consumers to throw the items they previously owned away and purchase new items. In many cases, the items that consumers are encouraged to throw away are perfectly functional. For example, as Packard pointed out, each year Americans throw away hundreds of pounds of food scraps, food scraps that were previously fed to dogs. At the same time, Americans spend a third of a billion dollars on prepared dog food. Another method corporations employ to encourage consumers to purchase their items is through both perceived (psychological) and planned obsolescence. For perceived (psychological) obsolescence, consumers are persuaded to replace older models of a specific product with newer, “better” models. However, often the only difference between these two models is “superficial changes and improvements" and a great deal of money. For planned obsolescence, companies will engineer a product to break down at a specific time. I was also shocked to learn that marketers working for the Holland Furnace Company illegally pretend to be government officials and then dismantled people’s furnaces and told them that they had to purchase new furnaces! It is sickening how far corporations will go in the name of profits. What I find insane is that in most cases, these profits end up in the hands of a select few. I highly doubt that the Holland Furnace Company marketers are millionaires themselves. This article made me wonder if corporations truly cared about anything other than profits. I left this article feeling somewhat discouraged. How are we supposed to change American consumer culture when it has been present for so many decades and when it is foundational to our economy. Regardless, it must change.

You made some fantastic points here. To start off, "planned obsolescence" is in itself, the epitome of corruption. To think that companies manufacture their products specifically so that they have a certain lifespan is unbelievably heinous to me, not just on the basis of waste, but on the basis of ethics. People are spending their hard-earned money to buy their products, whether it be for themselves or someone else, and it's entirely possible that they cannot afford to buy it again when the time comes. On top of that, profits aren't worth the destruction of the Earth. I don't get how someone, especially someone in power, with all the knowledge and resources available to them, could knowingly and negatively impact the planet for an extra buck. The  Holland Furnace Company is an especially disgusting example of this. To trick people who had no clue of the validity of your claims, and exploiting them even if they had nothing to exploit, is truly disgusting. 
           <br><br>


Secondly, waste is a huge problem, and where I draw issue with our companies using marketing strategies to make people feel as though their perfectly functional product is inferior to newly released ones despite there being minute differences between the two. Take iPhones for example. Every time one gets released, it's all the craze and everyone wants to get one,  but the only real difference one gets is camera quality and maybe screen size. And the funny part is, you wouldn't even realize you "needed' these until the new one gets released. So, while I am not opposed to capitalism/consumerism as a whole, because I do think they possess their fair share of benefits, this throwaway culture needs to be removed immediately if we are ever going to make a legitimate difference in the state of today's climate.


<br><hr>
I agree with you on the deliberateness of the corporations in their marketing strategies. When the professor mentioned that the AMA had released a statistic that Joe Camel was widely recognized by children, I was shocked at how widespread their marketing strategy was. When he followed up by saying that that ⅓ of all cigarettes sold to minors were Camels, I literally gasped. Though it does not seem that an industry would be capable of engaging in unethical behavior, their intent created the outcome that they wanted. Consumer culture is just what has been deliberately created in order to enable spending money on products sold by corporations.
           <br><br>
Like you, when I read Packard’s “The Waste Makers,” I could not believe the other marketing strategies that corporations have created as well in order to increase consumer purchase. Packard begins with explaining how the market works in terms of profit and production. Corporations emphasize an increase of consumption or otherwise, the economy would sicken. An emphasis on consumption is made because corporations produce not due to what is needed, but rather stimulation of the economy. Therefore, there are numerous marketing tactics in order to stimulate consumer purchase. Basically, you are relying on something that requires more and more, as any failure to grow in the market would create potential for an economic recession. A reliance on the market economy is thus what leads to the great consumption of Americans.
           <br><br>
The U.S. economy is a productive economy, so it requires people to spend in order for the economy to remain stimulated. The marketing practices are almost unbelievable if you are not familiar with the American economy. Purchasing extra, throwing away more, planned obsolescence are all consumer characteristics that have been shaped by our market economy. One thing that really angered me in particular for some reason was the  marketing of a potato peeler the same color as potatoes in order for consumers to accidentally throw them away. The disposability of products, as well as other strategies, are deliberate as the main goal of corporations is to generate profit.
           <br><br>
In other lectures and in this book as well, it seems that World War 2 is a significant point in time which increased consumer culture. Taking historical context into consideration, a focus on the market was deemed the solution to stimulate the broken economy caused by  the Great Depression. This is because capitalism has been the political economy of the state for centuries, and the only viable solution was capitalism. A strong emphasis on the market, production, and consumption was thus made in order to the state out of financial difficulty which was created by capitalism to begin with.

What impacted me most about The Waste Makers was Packard’s argument about obsolescence and how durable products are now considered “products that will outlast the final installment payment.” This purposeful production of low quality goods, also known as “planned obsolescence,”  for the sole purpose of profit creates copious amounts of waste.lWhile we as consumers play a large role in this vicious cycle, it is ultimately the responsibility of manufacturing companies to further these destructive shopping habits. As made clear in this week’s reading, many companies overproduce the amount of goods and actually need more consumers. They increase their supply of goods even when there is a small demand, and then must compensate through persuasive marketing techniques. This process seems extremely illogical and unproductive to me. It also seems foolish from the consumers’ side, as we are buying things that only last as long as we can afford them. Another problem with this system is that much of our waste (coming from the developed world) ends up in poorer countries, creating dumping grounds out of places that are not responsible for our own messes.

In Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers, it was interesting to read the way marketing and consumerism works. It is evident that people today are becoming more materialistic than before. As Packard mentioned, we are now consuming twice as much as citizens did before World War II. Since people are finding joy and happiness in shopping, people are buying a lot more stuff than they actually need. As first introduced in the chapter, people’s possessions are “spilling” over the attics, windows, and doors of their homes. Also, consumerism has escalated due to how fast the production process has become, and fast fashion is a perfect example of how fast companies can produce and sell their products. I think other companies are now trying to follow the same production model since fast fashion companies have become very successful. As a result of this production process, however, there is excess, unnecessary waste. It is especially wasteful when companies overproduce items and they do not sell. I believe that both the companies and consumers should be more environmentally conscious in this situation.

I feel as though "The Waste Makers" really exposed the world's overly consumerist habits. It's crazy to think that people have completely switched from buying what they absolutely needed to get by to just buying whatever you want and can afford. We truly have become a materialistic society. We're so focused on owning more and more things that we're never truly appreciative of what we have. It's like we'll never be satisfied with what we have, we always want more, and it has become to the point where we either constantly hoard stuff or we constantly replace things that aren't even broken are needing replacement. It's insane to see how post world war II's economic boom seemed to effect the ways we approach consumerism now. Not many people truly see the extent of how bad we have become with purchasing things we don't need. Especially with advertising these days on social media, and I feel as a female on social media it can be even more compelling because we see these social media influencers showing off their luxurious lifestyles and promoting cool products. It makes us feel like maybe if we have those products too we'll eventually feel satisfied with ourselves and the things we have, but its an ongoing thing because we're constantly being bombarded with new things to buy that because the influencers say its cool we should automatically go out and purchase it because it is cool. I really just think we need to find a way to control our materialistic indulgent tendencies, and "The Waste Makers" makes that really obvious.

As my experience with a respected economist, there is a strategy used by a lot of companies to increase sale of their products. That is to advertise their product so good that consumers will buy excessively. In other words, he was suggesting same idea that is presented in Vance Packard’s book “The Waste Makers” that American (and any population that can afford certain goods, I believe) excessive consumerism evolved from owning limited possessions to buying excessive products that actually has no contribution to their physical well-being. An example of that is smartphones. Recently, world's leading companies release two models annually, like Apple with their iPhones. By claiming that they are making big improvements every year, Apple conveys consumers to change their phones annually, even if their phone works perfectly. Although Apple claim that they are devoting in recycling of resources and re-using wasted products, such habit of buying new products on a regular basis for it is new instead of needs is now spreading across the world in different consuming scenarios. If we think about the manufacturing process of those products, we can then realize how much excessive waste and emissions have created by those excessive consumerism. We should revisit our mind of consumerism so that we can reduce the emission.

After reading Chapters 2-7 of "The Waste Maker" it showed me the American ideology of consumerism. It's shocking how much an average American consumes goods compared to now and the past. People are buying things that are not essential but possessing luxury or optional items. But from an economic point, consumerism must rise in order for an increase in wages but an increase in goods. Families are replacing "old" goods into newer products, for example, an old tv being replaced for a 4K Ultra HD TV. It's the mentally of "new" and "improving" things causing them to get rid of or sell these possessions. Comparing the United States to Russia and how much we are outproducing Russia does need to be taken into notice. The ratio is 20:1. In chapter 3 Packard states, "They are passionately convinced that the great challenge facing the nation is to make sure the citizenry will be induced to enjoy more and more of the good things of life-which they, of course, will be more than happy to produce." This shows how consumerism is regulated. The more people consume is great for markets because they will happily produce more. It is simply a good system but unhealthy for a typical American. This contradicts the idea of minimalism because if people lived more simply then how will this affect the economy and the producers.

Consumerism in America while it may be beneficial for the market and economic growth, it proves detrimental to the environment. The trend of over consumption and increased products and waste is leading to devastating effects on the environment. We are now reaching a turning point where consumption is at an all time high and resources are at an all time low. While the pressure to conform to the societal norms of having the most material possessions presses on, we must make the executive decision to live a minimalist lifestyle as the future of our climate is at stake. Consumer culture inflicts a sense of guilt on buyers of who can have the most material possessions when there is no need for them. I agree with your statement “It is simply a good system but unhealthy for a typical American” the system was built well but it is extremely unhealthy as you will never feel fully satisfied as there are always bigger and better items out. We must take our focus away from the culture and do what is best for the environment and our futures.

Reading this made me completely see advertising around me differently. It’s amazing how companies do the most to sell products to the public. I found myself thinking how it’s almost comical that we fall for the advertising. A quote that really stood out to me me was: “Whether growth is particularly needed to promote the wellbeing of the American people is rarely even considered.” In economics we learn how GDP determines the wellbeing of our country, but economic growth largely depends on us as consumers buying an endless amount of thing, which we’ve already seen only makes us unhappy. I found it interesting how no result improvements have been made to most of the things we buy, but simply it’s been made “cooler.” I liked the toaster example. All you need is a basic toasted to toast bread, but you go to the home appliance section and you’ll find all kinds of toaster. And the best part is people are convinced they need to buy anything other than a basic toaster. J. Walter Thompson, chief economist of the world's largest advertising agency explained that people didn’t know they needed to buy more things so he suggested “activation by advertising.” I can’t help but think it’s kind of smart, like a good villain scheme. Except we pay the price because all day long we are bombarded with advertisements of all sorts, which affect our everyday purchases. It’s almost a little absurd using the term “everyday purchases” because what can we possibly need to buy every single day? The idea of two homes at one point was appealing to me, but now I see it as a way to get me to buy twice as many things. Reading this opened my eyes to how advertising works, and how the only goal is to make profit for companies.

I think the author really predicted what was happening and going to happen in the future. The author saw that people were consuming at a very alarming rate and realized that much of it was unneeded. He also identified how business had to be in order to keep selling which I thought was spot on with the 3 ways they can continue to sell. One way, the company making an improvement on the product, or at least making it seem that way is honestly what most tech companies, and even most companies do nowadays. This is very evident with Apple who are always coming out with a new product, and then trying to improve upon that product even though the “old” ones worked totally fine. Also the facts about the farming industry is scary since we are pouring so much money into it for nothing. I believe that both parties are responsible for our downfall, both consumers and companies. Companies are really corrupt and will try to sell to people regardless of the cost, whether it be deaths such as the tobacco industry or any other way. Also consumers need to realize that they do not need to buy everything and that materials don’t make a person, how you act and conduct yourself is what makes a person. I believe that the combination of advertising and culture really hurts people as it results in rapid consumerism. Therefore, I believe that both are very big factors in causing the problem of waste making.

After reading the chapters assigned, it really reminded me of how wasteful our society is and how focused our culture is on consumerism. Things are constantly being released to the public prompting people to buy more and more. Our culture is so focused on this that it's almost looked down upon if you don't have the most latest and greatest item. People buy stuff not because they necessarily need it, but as a culture they are compelled to buy the new fad or thing in order to fit in. You can really see it going on around the world when something new pops up, the masses flock to go buy those products. An example i thought of was on black friday, you see so many people line up and  camp out to buy products they don't really need all because they are getting  little discount on it.

 I felt similarly to how you did after reading "The Waste Makers" because I was reminded of the wasteful nature our society has adopted more and more as time goes on. The reading focused on the idea of "planned obsolescence", which highlights people's need to purchase products simply because there is a newer and trendier version, as opposed to buying products because their old product no longer works. People get tired of things too easily because they don't feel satisfied by the "aesthetic" of it anymore, when they should actually be concerned with the impacts of getting rid of a product before its actual shelf life was maxed out. I found it interesting that you brought up black friday because this day is the perfect example of how some people fiend to buy things, especially things that they don't necessarily need, simply because it becomes more accessible to them. Large corporations use days like black friday to lure people into purchasing more products, thus harming the planet immensely.

After perusing and dissecting parts 2 to 7 of Vance Packard's "The Waste Maker", The author digs deeply into The business techniques of corporate greed and the endless cycle of commercialization that Americans’ loathe. In particular, Mr. Packard's clarification of "outdated quality arrangements" highlights the extent to which companies have an insatiable need to ensure that they deliberately fail to produce within a given time frame. It also conveys how they manipulate and unethically mistreat Americans. "Outdated quality arrangements" encourage the passive, endless tendency of customers to keep buying. In addition to the inconvenience to the emotional health of buyers, it is also unimaginably unsafe for the prosperity of our planet, including further atmospheric emergencies.

This reading felt surreal. I was reading this next to my roommate and was telling him once in a few chapters something that stood out to me. By the end he was getting frustrated and was telling me to stop being a conspiracy theorist and that the author was exaggerating. I had to read him passages so that he would believe me.

           <br><br>

The amount of research that goes into selling a product is truly baffling. The idea of trying to actively plan out how the consumer will buy the next product during the current product development is really surprising. I think the author did a good job in not directly critiquing this idea but instead tried to explain how it works. He points out that new products sometimes do have greater functionality and new features which make them worthy of replacing the current models. However the idea of trying to increase the desirability of the new product while decreasing that of the old one really makes the reader question how ethical this form of product development is. 
           <br><br>


Again, I think it's very smart that he didn't directly criticize this or take a stance and even went as far as presenting the arguments for this form of development. The reason for this is that consumer capitalism is not something to critique lightly: as the very foundation of the US economic system, any criticism towards it has a high chance of garnering opposition from the reader. This opposition is natural from the fact that this system has been very successful in accumulating the sufficient wealth to allow for the unprecedented quality of life many enjoy in the US. However whether this prosperity was worth it if it means being wasteful and destroying the planet is a whole other question.

Wow, I never thought that someone would think Vance Packard's bestseller would be full of conspiracy theories. I find that kind of cool, actually. That means that the book was interesting enough. 
           <br><br>
This is my second time reading these chapters, and yet, I still found it interesting to read. I enjoyed Wallace-Wells' article and Packard's writing because of how vividly they detail their respective topics.  I agree with you on how Packard did an excellent job in explaining how Americans have been led to become such wasteful consumers. His specific examples were what really made the reading interesting. Some people realize advertisers are manipulating people to buy, such as with iPhones or Nintendo consoles, but I bet that people who read The Waste Makers were shocked by how much consumers are manipulated. It's hard for people to imagine that such detailed planning is performed to merely sell a product.  Packard's writing really explains how much effort was put into crafting the current system. I am daunted by how much effort and planning it would take to change the system again. Most people don't even realize how wasteful they are, and if they do think they're being wasteful, they don't realize the extent of their wastefulness and the impact it has on the environment. Initially, I thought myself as someone that isn't too affected by consumer culture and being wasteful, since I don't shop and I wear my clothes until they break, but then I realized how many pairs of shoes I have. I wear three pairs of shoes, which is why I forgot that I probably have more than ten pairs of shoes somewhere. It wouldn't be much a big deal for me to cut back even more, but there are some people I wouldn't even consider mentioning consumer culture in a negative way with. I don't feel the effects of consumer culture on me too much, but they do affect me in ways I don't notice. I find it concerning that some people have spent and will spend their entire lives trapped by the desire to stay stylish and continue buying. 
           <br><br>
Again, it's rather scary to see the influence powerful corporations have on everyone. They've even managed to have the people they're using defend their interests unknowingly.

Vance Packard’s book “The Waste Makers” does an excellent job in demonstrating how American consumerism has evolved from owning limited possessions to buying abundant amounts of products and discarding them at faster rates. While companies are essentially encouraging such wasteful behavior, they are not the only ones to blame, we as consumers also have to take part of the blame. It shocked me to find how 50’s consumerism took off from what it was to what it is now. American consumerism becoming the new normal is something that needs to change. In my opinion, both the consumers and companies who are manufacturing products are responsible for this new unchecked consumerism. Companies have made it their goal to try to get consumers to want and buy more, but at the end of the day, consumers are still responsible for making those purchases. However, it does not make this tactic acceptable in any way. I think it is important to acknowledge what Ken says about how companies choose their needs and audiences. They know very well who is gonna fall for their ads and products, so we need to question ourselves before we make those purchases. 
            <br><br>

One of the most interesting parts of this reading was in chapter six, when the issue of obsolescence is mentioned. I can’t say I am surprised manufacturers are designing items to wear out within a few years and essentially possessing limited utility. However, that does not make it any less wrong. Obsolescence of function and desirability are the most prominent in my purchases. When I already have an item, if there's a new model I almost always want it, especially when it comes to electronics. When there’s a new iPhone every year, I try to convince myself that I need it simply because it has a better camera quality, even if I have the previous model that works perfectly fine. Reading the assigned chapters of “The Waste Makers” made me reflect on my purchases. The majority of the time when I am buying something I need, I end up purchasing other items I do not need. I make careless purchases simply because of boredom or something just being available. I think as consumers we need to start taking responsibility for our own actions. Americans should not continue to encourage mass consumerism and get discard it more quickly.

After reading several chapters of Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” and its in-depth analysis of modern American consumerism, I was shocked to see how numbered marketers and advertisers have the power of altering the mentality and buying behavior of a large group of consumers. According to a survey mentioned by Leon Kelley, the executive of Fishler, Zealand & Co: “It was found that nine out of ten experts preferred a chair selling at $1, capable of serving the customer approximately one year, over a chair that would cost $1.25 which might last for about five years.” This really shows the absurdity of the mentality “the newer the better” as it fails to recognize the long-term cost associated with durability. Thanks to this new mentality of consumerism, a lot of waste is generated, not for maintaining our lifestyles but for companies and cooperates to generate more profits. At the same time, consumers have no choice but to pay the extra costs for these throwaway packages (which sometimes cost more than the product itself ironically). Similar to the idea proclaimed in the documentary film “Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things” from last week, these two materials are both common in terms of blaming corporates for designing and producing products that aren’t meant to be durable, and this changes the behaviors and psychology of people when it comes to purchasing. I do not think it is a coincidence that corporates are the catalysts of modern consumerism when both materials provided sufficient evidence and reasoning while trying to expose the corporates' actions.

Nowadays, I sometimes get worried if I forget to pack anything before a trip. Then, I simply reassure myself that if anything, I can always just buy it later. Although this was an innocent thought to fret less, I now have a better understanding of the environmental and societal consequences. In Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers,” the author discusses the mentality shift from using things until they’re broken to throwing out-of-style items away. Interestingly, Packard also discusses three possibilities for sales if your consumer already owns your product. He says, “You sell replacements; you sell more than one item to each family; or you dream up a new or improved product-or one that at least seems new or improved-that will enchant families that already own an ‘old’ model of your product. (A fourth possibility is to move into a different line.)”  In addition to your discussion on the survey, I am not surprised people are preferring to pay for a cheaper poor quality item than a more expensive high quality product. This year, my sister was debating on buying or leasing a new car. She was eyeing a specific car due to its adaptive cruise control. In the end, my sister decided to lease the car, and her main reason was that technology has been so advanced lately that it would not be smart to commit to a car if something better was going to come out later. I don’t think she should feel guilty or bad for that being her main reason, but it really shows the new mentality of consumerism in our society today.

I really liked what you had to say about how corporations create this consumer culture we see in the United States and how they are able to change our mentality about the ownership of things. I was also shocked when I noticed how strong of an influence they have on how and what we spend our money on. Packard writes,“The United States economy is depending on the willingness of consumers and the government to spend more each year than they have the preceding year”(19). It looks like our entire country is relying on us to keep buying, and to spend more than we already are. I was so surprised to read that people buying more stuff gives the economy several billion dollars, which creates pay raises, farm subsidies, missiles, and highways. I also knew that Americans are very wasteful but I wasn’t aware of how much compared to other countries and how much of the stuff we own that we don’t even use. You also talked about the the “throwaway” mentality that we have developed which causes us to waste more, and then continue to buy. I never even realized that the plastic toys that we played with as kids were teaching us that everything in this world is replaceable. This quote really stood out to me and it says,“Tomorrow, more than ever, our life will be ‘disposable’”(45). This just shows that out consumer culture is being fed and being made bigger, but at the cost of our planet. There will always be bigger and better things, so we will always be buying.

Vance Packard's "The Waste Makers" did an excellent job at exposing the wolf in the sheepskin to his audience, for once, the blame didn't feel like it was put on the the general public, but rather the companies and corporations that incite and perpetuate the cycle of consumerism apparent in American society today. I read this article in a state of disbelief. I have always understood that companies revolve around profit, but it was horrifying to see real life examples of truly how far they will go to achieve wealth for their higher-ups. It's absolutely disgusting realizing how they manipulate the public to get rich. While some examples of this manipulation are somewhat harmless to consumers,  industries such as the tobacco industry should be viewed with the same disgust we hold genocide-causing dictators to. 
            <br><br>

It is apparent now that this consumerist cycle has taken off since its birth during WWII and has continued to grow until all elements of society are impacted. This way of life has been embedded into each and every American family for generations, which will make it extremely difficult to break. While the general public should be held accountable for their ignorant actions, now is the time to spread awareness so we can begin to combat this issue before it is too late.

The new normal to normal discussion really intrigues me. The Waste Makers brings up plenty of examples of how corporations have been able to lure us into constant consumption which then creates contrast profit for them. I found the section on the production of lawnmowers interesting as its development and sale parallels that of many companies today.

            <br><br>

In modern times we see the lawnmower companies methods of manipulation in products today, especially the iphone.  The motorized lawn mower and its evolution reminds me of the evolution of the iphone’s headphone jack. The lawnmower industries, by introducing motorized lawn mowers created the idea that pushing hand powered mower was somehow “shameful”.

            <br><br>

When apple got rid of the headphone jack with their iphone 7, they introduced airpods which were created to make up for the loss of the wired headphones. Airpods cost $160 compared to the $20 wired headphones apple included with their phones and ipods. Though they do include a wired headphone when you purchase a phone, the user phone cannot charge their phone and use the headphones at the same time. Added that social media created an idea that wired headphones signaled that you were “broke”, airpod sales took off and apple continued to make exponential profit by making something obsolete.

In the article, the author, Vance Packard, talks about the concept of “consumerism”, and further analysis it in details. According to the book, the concept of consumerism was generated by the increase in productivities and the number of facilities that produce those products. As the productivity rises, the consumers’ purchasing power also increases, and therefore, generates the concept of consumerism. 
            <br><br>

Accords to what we learned last week, I know that the consumption cannot bring happiness to people, instead, it makes people to feel less satisfied. Under this idea’s influence, many people believe that they can obtain happiness from buying stuffs, but actually they can’t. The idea of consumerism acts as a blackhole to suck consumers money into sellers’ pocket. 
            <br><br>

In the book, the author says “But how much should we rejoice when General Electric introduces a toaster with nine buttons, which make it possible to obtain a piece of toast in any nine shades? How much should we rejoice when another company introduces a mechanical martini-stirring spoon, which relieves the person stirring from the labor of twisting his wrist? And what American housewife is dreaming of the day when she can prepare breakfast by simply flicking a bedside switch, which will turn on an electronic recipe maker coded on punch cards?” According to this idea, he suggests that people should avoid unnecessary purchase of goods and think thoroughly before they buy stuffs.

I agree with you on the idea that we need to buy things that we actually need. Buying more things, things we see on commercials, doesn't make an impact on our happiness.  However, it's clear that "The Waste Makers" talk about how to stimulate the economy, consumers must buy more and more, keeping the cycle of supply and demand. This gives me a new perspective that buying things doesn't directly make us happy. But buying things help stimulate the economy, create more jobs, and improve our lifestyles. This is a sad cycle that influences the culture we have now when there is fast-fashion, consuming products. It is going to be a challenge to change the way econ works. How do we maintain good, growing economy while not buying, throwing, and buying and throwing away things? How to find an environmental alternative to consumers that can benefits the economy?

In this reading, Vance Packard provides a history of consumerism, from WW2 onwards, that has been propelled by corporate greed in the U.S. It is interesting how companies were effective in making American culture all about consuming goods in a wasteful manner; they were able to change the mindsets of the entire population into buying things they had previously not desired so much of. They were able to do so through their marketing strategies rather than significant improvements in products. Some of the ideas that they disseminated were the need to contribute to economic growth through consumption, buy multiples of the same product, replace their products often, and so on. Even though this book was written decades ago, most of the items that Packard mentions are still relevant today, and most likely even more rampant. The consumerist culture has not changed, either.
            <br><br>
hat really stood out to me was his perspective of all the new strategies of companies of his time, compared to what I think of as normal due how common such occurrences are in the modern day. He talks about how watches were becoming accessories while I have always seen them sold as either luxury items or fashion accessories, with function as a less highlighted aspect of them. He talks about disposable razors as a ridiculous new product, while they are the most common type of razor sold in stores now. These items that were transformed in his lifetime in order to increase consumption have simply become normal now. Looking at items like watches or razors from his time, despite being less wasteful, would be just as ridiculous from the norms today, showing how consumerist culture has only gotten worse.

After reading this book, I am slightly frustrated, knowing how all of these intentional marketing efforts have contributed to the climate change crisis that we now face. Overconsumption is one of the major issues, and it was purposefully fostered by product companies through obsolescence- whether it was of function, quality, or desirability. I was shocked when I read about how manufacturers intentionally created potato peelers in the same color as potatoes so that they’re more likely to be thrown away, and therefore the public will have to purchase more of this item. Not only that, but the manufacturers decided to sell these potato peelers in a brightly colored box to ensure it would catch people’s attention. I never realized how much consideration went into the design of products; I thought companies mainly focused on how to make their items more appealing. Instead, manufacturers are manipulating the public in creating items that will either have a short life span or can be thrown away, requiring the purchase of more. In the book, Mr. Safford questioned if purposeful design for product is unethical, and I understand that companies must promote consumerism for their own sake, but I do think it is immoral. Especially now, as overconsumption and overproduction continue to worsen the climate change situation, these manufacturers are directly causing harm to the environment, in addition to deceiving Americans. This book has definitely opened my eyes to the meticulous planning that occurs behind product designs and advertisements, and I hope I am now more aware of the ways that companies try to convince us to purchase more of their items and won’t be fooled by their tactics.

As I was reading The Waste Makers, I was surprised to see that a great deal of the concepts presented are similar to concepts that we notice today: a great deal of people are consuming products at an alarming rate. If two-fifths of the things owned in the fifties were not essential to their physical well-being, what fraction of the items an average person today owns is not essential to our life as a human? It is a little scary to think about what that number might be. Nobody needs technology for the sake of their well-being, but we all buy it anyways. I alone have four pieces of technology that are not essential to my health. 
            <br><br>

The idea of having a "two-house family" is also prominent in today's society. Most American families today have multiple cars. One for every driver in the family and sometimes more than that. Some people also have multiple phones. I know at least three people who have a work phone and a personal phone. I even know people who have multiple homes: they have their every-day house, vacation house, and beach house that are all for their personal use, and none of them get rented out to other people while they are not there. 

            <br><br>

It is also crazy to think about planned obsolescence. This is a manipulative strategy that is completely unnecessary, and there is no way to justify it. Companies are taking advantage of consumers in order to make a profit. It is ethically wrong to purposely make a product last for a shorter amount of time just to get more money from them. I understand that some products do not last for a long period of time, but any company who shortens the lifespan on their product for the sole reason of making money needs to rethink their morals. And not only does it hurt consumers, but it also hurts the planet. Planned obsolescence forces people to discard products at a faster rate and thus contributing to waste and pollution on the planet.

There used to be a time where every single item we owned was cherished. Now, companies have realized that they can manipulate consumers using planned obsolescence. Our society is latched onto the idea that new is always better and everything is replaceable. If there is an update to a product we already own, we always feel the need to purchase it. It is true, “Nowhere in the world except in the United States would a skyscraper office building in sound condition be torn down merely to be replaced by another one.”
            <br><br>

I am a firm believer in the saying,“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” However, I know plenty of people in my personal life that will go out and purchase the latest iPhone every time a new one is released even though their current phone works perfectly fine. It is simply unnecessary. Why do we feel the need to purchase the same items we already own but slightly updated? This cycle is a trap.
            <br><br>

I agree, companies are taking advantage of costumers for money. My family and I have experienced planned obsolescence with our cars. In 2014, my family had two cars, one was about 15 years old and the other was about 7 years old. My family thought that the older car was going to stop working long before the new car. We were wrong. That year, the engine of our newer 7-year-old car stopped working. While there are potentially many other factors that could have caused this, my family and I think that newer cars are made “differently.” I believe car companies are purposely making cars that will only last about 7 years. This forces consumers to buy another car but at the same time it is a long enough period of time that most consumers will not be suspicious. This marketing tactic is immoral and creates a lose-lose situation for consumers and our planet.

<br><hr>
I am glad that someone else sees what is happening in our society. I also know a good amount of people that buy iPhones right when the new one comes out. They don't even think twice about getting a new one when their current ones could last them at least another year. Too many people buy into the idea that an upgrade is necessary when the company says it is necessary. I think if people can refrain from buying something for the sole reason that it is a new model, we can keep companies from taking advantage of us. 
            <br><br>

Not only will refraining from purchasing new models help consumers but it will help the planet as well. Consumers need to take control for our own sake and the sake of the planet.

While reading The Waste Makers by Vance Packard, I was thrilled to find that it discusses techniques and delves into how these corporations function in order to get us, the consumers, to consume more and more. One technique that stood out for me was that of purposely making products not last long and then marketing newer ones as “upgrades” or “improvements.” I relate to this in my own life when it comes to Apple products. I used to always want the newest most up to date version because I genuinely believed that it would be better and ultimately improve my life. Boy was I wrong. This ties in with the minimalist movement in the sense that buying products and consuming does not make us happy and only fills the void many of us have for the time being. I am truly grateful to have taken this course as this lecture provides insight to how I, the consumer, am being manipulated to buy more. Many of these companies do not give a rat’s ass about us either. Examples of this are shown within the tobacco industry and how they deliberately choose to sell a product that will take ten years from someone’s life in the name of profit. Corporations are only driven by profit and always look for ways to maximize it. One ideology that I had not taken into account was the fact that buying cheaper items is not the best option. Not only does it ultimately harm our planet further, but because it is marketed as cheaper, it will not last long. This causes us to, in turn, buy more and more of that item to replace the broken, dilapidated one. Despite being made roughly 60 years ago, The Waste Makers is still highly prevalent in our culture today.

Vance Packard's, "The Waste Makers" does an excellent job in showing the reader how Americans today are puppets and enslaved to consumerism. When you think of a utopia you think about the most perfect world where nothing goes wrong, however the utopia discussed in the beginning chapter was very ironic because "Cornucopia City" was said to be the consumer dream, yet it's actually a nightmare planned out by business owners and large corporations so that people can continue buying new things. In the future every material object will be made to have a short lifespan so that the economy can thrive which in the end just contributes to our carbon footprint and pollutes the world which in my opinion is the opposite of a utopia. I found it funny how Packard described us as a "nation on a tiger" and that the only way to sustain this "hyperthyroid economy" was constant stimulation of the nation's resources by prodigally consuming more goods so that they won't get consumed by this "tiger" which could be multiple things such as society, the government or large corporations. The word "prodigality" stuck with me while reading the book because I see people today, including my friends and family, wasting things that they shouldn't have even bought in the first place and it makes me wonder how many people in this world do the same.
            <br><br>

 I wasn't surprised that the average U.S. citizen was consuming twice as much than those before world war 2 because I feel that since the war was over people shifted their focus towards life and what it had to offer them so they went trigger happy with all their expenditures. Also you can't forget about the boomers rapidly increasing the population which meant people needed to consume more so that more people can have jobs. I feel that is why that moment of time was referred to as the "Throwaway age" because things were being made to break down so that people could buy more. This escalated into a negative feed back loop and made it so that if merchandise does not wear out fast then people will be unemployed. I find it dumb how our country still thinks it has to prove itself of being the best industrial nation and how they compare themselves to other nations whose economy is still under development by producing more things. Our nations leaders need to get on that Pokemon grind and learn that a level 1 Pokemon levels up faster than a level 90 Pokemon.
            <br><br>

With the amount of advertisements increasing and important people such as Eisenhower telling people to buy anything because that was the only way to get out of the recession at the time, people were buying and wasting more and becoming actual waste makers. The only way businesses were able to get people to buy more things were to lie to consumers and give them plausible excuses for their actions such as "It's in style" or "small equals cheap and bad while big equals good and expensive." sort of like how Spongebob and Patrick did when they were selling chocolates. Businesses even made people buy things that they didn't need by using the slogan "time lag" which made Americans continue to consume and adopt this throw away mood.

I too was intrigued by the utopia that Packard described. However, to go along with your pop culture references, all I could think of was us turning into the society from Wall-E. Packard described how companies which sells goods meant to be used and kept for years had to come up with new ways to reinvent themselves so that people would keep buying their items. When he asked how long it will be until we buy machines that are built to do our most basic of jobs like stirring a martini, all I could think about was in how the people in Wall-E had machines do EVERYTHING for them, including moving them around when they could walk. I fear that that is the future of our species if we continue like this, and the future of our planet to turn up like the waste land cleaned by robots. 
            <br><br>

We have to stop these business schemes if we are going to be able to make a change in the way we consume. Ken mentioned how cigarettes have to be labelled with the health risks and can no longer be advertised. I think that having these same restrictions on products that pose harm to the environment is exactly what we need. Most people do not search up the most environmentally friendly options before going to the store to get what they need (or want), but if it was labelled on the products themselves then the consumer would have to pay attention and it would be easier for them to make environmental choices.

Reading "The Waste makers" by Vince Packard, made me realize the true problem of society, it made me realize that I'm part of the problem within the society. We have all been brainwashed and fallen victim to desire and control of these major corporations. In his book, Vince Packard highlights the monstrosity of the common culture of American Consumerism and how these major corporations enact upon us to get us to buy their next appliance or the bigger and better television set. It's truly fascinating, yet disheartening how gullible we, the American people, can be. We have been blinded to the fact that we are just insects, who mindlessly run to the store to buy the next iPhone for hundreds, even thousands, of dollars all because we have an empty sense of desire within us that we must suffice in order to feel good about ourselves. Many people say can't blame us for falling to the propaganda of these major corporations, but it's partially our fault. We have came to this low point, and we know we have, yet we continue because we think we're doing our economy a favor or even ourselves a favor, or some bullshit to put us at ease. Vince Packard explains in detail of all the ways  how these major companies get us to buy their products; all the way from attacking us inside  (their main secret), convincing us that we need it, to simply changing the packaging or a couple of cents on the dollar, and much more.
            <br><br>
It also doesn't surprise me how money-hungry these companies are, but it's just truly mind-boggling the lengths some of these companies are willing to go to to sell us a product or have us come back to purchase the new one. Who in their right mind would lower the quality of their product, sabotaging the quality in itself, just to get them to come back to buy another in the next 6-12 months. They show this true disregard for not only their customers and common consumer, but to the environment; in a sense that they are willing to sacrifice extra materials, extra time, expend more fuel and greenhouse gasses into our atmosphere, all of which destroy our planet, for a couple extra millions. This truth is very disheartening, thinking how could you possible put a price on the place we live in. Vince Packard has shown us who the fools are, and crazy the world us that we live in. Not crazy, but blatantly ignorant and selfish.

I am wasting food right now. My roommates and I bought two boxes of cereal, ate it once, and currently, it is sitting on top of the fridge getting more stale each day. We have not thrown it out like the lazy college students we are. I spent money on food that I didn’t even finish eating. I spent money on food that I could get at the dining commons anytime (it isn’t free in a sense but the resource is still provided). Despite the old cereal that sits on top of my fridge, I keep buying new snacks that I think will “satisfy” me but in reality, only creates clutter and misery from the growing clutter. Reading “Making Waste” felt like I was reading something about me; somehow the author knew what I was doing and wrote about it. The conviction was real. Americans, I included, create so much waste and this is such an amazing but harmful privilege; there is so much power from just even having that ability to buy and wasting anything any time we want. Some of this comes from really good advertising as I’ve learned from the book and piecing together things that I’ve noticed or glimpsed at from my everyday life. Humans are manipulated to buy something that is commonly advertised whether it is through the television or on large billboards in the city even if it’s something useless or unnecessary. Weird fact but the first Kidzbop CD gained almost 18 million dollars and it was only advertised and sold through the television. Americans have so much that they don’t need and Vance Packard wrote effectively through the concept of “planned obsolescence”. 
            <br><br>

The “obsolescence of desirability” concept stuck out to me, the conviction was strong on this one. Currently, I have the iPhone X but when the iPhone 11 dropped and advertised its new and improved camera, the only thought that entered my mind was “oh my gosh I need this, the camera looks so nice, I could probably take some nice photos with that”. Because of the camera, I wanted a totally new phone even though I have a nice and recent model of an iPhone. Whether or not they deny this, each and every American is selfish in some way about Packard’s concepts of “planned obsolescence”. This piece was very eye-opening and very informative to me personally.

I found the chapters that we read from The Waste Makers as terrifying because I never realized that this system of getting us to buy more for the wrong reasons has been happening since the 50s. Hearing them say how companies would sell more colors of nail polish by marketing each color to match each mood was crazy to hear. Then again, since my entire life has been filled with this thought of nail polish colors and your outfits, it is not surprising it has been here for a while. I understand that this advertising is helping these companies make much more money but it is creating a larger carbon footprint for us all and is making the majority of people become more depressed. If we do not get the newest things we have FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) but if we get the newest things, then we feel unfulfilled until we are able to get the newer thing. It is a cycle that is putting us into a deeper hole of depression so that the rich can get richer.
            <br><br>
When hearing Ken talk about how often times this advertisement to buy more of anything and everything was indirectly directed toward children, I became mad. We continue to see this kind of advertising today with all the toys and games kids want now but will lose interest in when they see the newest advertisement for the newest toy. However, advertising things such as cosmetics and Camel cigarettes to children should be illegal. No child should have to think about things such as “I am beautiful enough” or “should I be wearing makeup to make myself prettier” at such a young age. In addition, targeting minors for the sale of cigarettes is just wrong because these things are addictive and can drastically ruin their lives but they don’t understand that severity. I know that Ken stated that smoking cigarettes can take off ten years off of someone’s life, but could this number become larger if they start smoking at the age of fourteen? How is the thought of people losing large sums of their lives an okay tradeoff to getting more money if you already have billions?

Vance Packard's classic 1960 study of consumerism, "The Waste Makers," delves into America’s futile cycle of consumption and disposal of common goods. In his work, Packard lists the many ways in which corporations advertise their products to Americans, acknowledging their dauntless marketing efforts and the small, trivial “enhancements” of their goods to be entirely subordinate to societal scrutiny.
            <br><br>


Although Packard was not an environmentalist himself, he considered consumerism to be a social issue and presented it as a bandwagon scheme. It is clear that the economy is dependent on the relationship between corporations and the public, but these corporations, without a doubt, prioritize their needs over the needs of the latter. I noticed that the connection that Ken drew between the tobacco industry and its consumers undoubtedly supports this fact, as many individuals, including several of my family members, have been subject to the consequences that arose as a result of the industry’s failure to inform its consumers for the sake of their own profit.

            <br><br>

While it is difficult to villainize corporations due to the fact that they provide us with products and services that we would otherwise fail to fulfill on our own accord, they are most definitely benefiting through their “systematic attempts of business to make us into wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently-discontented individuals.” Despite this bitter statement, there are many jobs that are reliant on these large industries, so it is understandable that their complete demise would surely be detrimental.

            <br><br>

Hopefully, Americans will begin to realize how much waste we have contributed to the world through the purchasing and disposing of products that we will eventually deem as useless. The solution to this is simple. We wouldn’t need to stop acquiring things altogether, but rather slow this process by considering what exactly we are purchasing and how the item would benefit us beforehand.

This week’s reading made me feel incredibly guilty to be part of the consumer culture. Packard neatly lays out the timeline of consumerism and how slowly but surely, obstacles such as the mid-20th century recession popped up that conveniently turned our society into one that “buys, buys, buys.” “Buy and be happy.” “Buy your way to prosperity.” Each popular slogan of the 1950s seemed to punch me in the gut a little more, turning my stomach sour from the guilt of being one of billions of consumers.

            <br><br>

I think in many ways it is inescapable, and I definitely agree with you that it is difficult to resent the businesses that provide us with goods and services that we would otherwise not easily obtain. On top of that, they cleverly start appealing trends such as color “matching” for glasses and clothes or pushing the expectation that a family should own two cars. 
            <br><br>


Consume, discard, and consume again. That’s the cycle we follow that has brought us to where we are today: a society dependent on consumerism. People eagerly jump onto these bandwagons without much of a second thought, and corporations, completely aware of this cycle of waste we are creating, continue to market their products to make profit.

Additionally, learning about the marketing techniques that industries use feels extra personal, because I’m considering pursuing a career in marketing. But I think it’s important to recognize that as long as I or anyone else interested in a marketing career is aware of the products we are marketing as well as their consequences in regards to the environment, consumerism, etc., the career path is not necessarily a bad one.

            <br><br>

Overall, I think it’s beneficial to all of us that we feel this guilt. It will motivate us to be less of “that person” and be more of the consumer-conscious, environmentally active individuals we need to be.

·      I agree with what you had to say Cortney, reading the first few chapters of Vance Packard’s book “The Waste Makers,” was very enlightening and an important read for everyone in America because it highlights everything wrong with our society and how we do things. He goes through the various way’s consumerism effects our planet and showcases how companies and industries do whatever it takes to get consumers to continue spending their money on their products, despite the harm they may do to them or the environment. This reading made me realize how easy it is to convince people that they need new shiny things every year getting s new car when the one you currently have is perfectly fine, having multiple TV’s in your home, and other unnecessary luxuries. It shows how wasteful and ungrateful our society is for constantly wanting to stay “on trend.” This is what is wrong everything we do and everything we buy has a terrible effect on our planet, yet no one realizes it. I know I did not fully realize the impacts until being in this class, and now that I do it is all I think about when shopping. Whenever I hear my friends or family talking about wanting a new article of clothing for no reason, I stop and ask them if they realize how horrible it is for not only the environment but for the people who probably made said item. No one really thinks about the cons and if they did the world would realize that the cons definitely outweigh the pros, and maybe some real change can start happening.

I agree with you. After reading “Waste Makers” it made me realize how much is wrong with modern day life. I believe it starts with the economy and business. According to “Waste Makers” television sets, automobiles, washing machines, refrigerators, rugs, draperies, various types of furniture, and a host of other appliances are so manufactured that they will be unusable within a few years. I find this crazy because our society is over manufacturing so many things to try and create better products when we don’t need to do this. Many businesses like this because they want people to buy their newest style products. This made me realize that businesses don’t really care about climate change but more about selling their latest products. They also don't care about how much they are wasting each year by creating new products. I am glad I read this as it made me aware of how corrupt businesses are.

It was truly interesting to see how the same problems from 60 years ago are still extremely prevalent today, and it is all because of one thing: the concept of American consumerism. Corporations have learned to reiterate the needs of society through the advertising of goods we do not neccassrily need, but have been accustomed to want, despite knowing its environmental and financial harm to ourselves and the world. I, for one, have been a long time contributor to this issue and have not seen the problem with the amount I spend or how much I buy until this class. All of my money goes to things I wear or use once and forget about, and I never saw it as a real problem because it was my money and my choice was to spend it. I didn’t think it would impact anyone else, much less be as harmful as it is– I actually thought it was good because I would end up donating it when I found it again. It is so easy for me to get sucked into the world of consumerism. I am the most gullible person in the world and will pull out my card for anything I find even remotely interesting because I need it that bad. For example, the book states a few examples of how some corporations advertised their products into tricking the consumer that they need more than one. When I saw the examples of nail polishes and glasses, I honestly felt personally attacked because those are the most I spend money on (besides fast fashion clothes, but that’s another problem). I have every single color in the rainbow as nail polish (like the book said) and I own 10+ pairs of glasses to go with different outfits. I even bought 2 pairs during one lecture. It’s crazy to me how this same problem from 60 years ago somehow become a problem in my life all because of corporations and consumerism.

I wasn’t surprised at all when I read that the sales of disposable items have been going up rapidly. People have been associating disposability with convenience. I used to buy some premade fried rice when I was in high school. It would come with a disposable box that can be placed in the microwave. All I had to do was to put it in the microwave for about 3 minutes, enjoy my meal, and then throw it away without bothering to dishwash. I knew that the packaging wasn’t cheap, and I wonder what the price of packaging is as compared to the price of the food inside. 
            <br><br>


Also, I think the author does a good job introducing the concept of obsolescence of quality, which is very related to our daily life and is sometimes unjustifiable. I have a lot of friends who use iPhones, and some of them have not updated their ios system for a long time. In their opinion, their phones might perform worse after the system update, because there is a possibility that Apple intentionally designed less qualified products in order to increase sales. Customers really don’t have transparent information on the planned obsolescence, and they don’t really have a choice (since Apple products are incompatible). The problem of obsolescence of quality should be criticized especially if the company knows well about its product and still decides to plan for obsolescence for its own interests.

I agree with your comment. People are buying food/produce that is easier to handle. I was watching a video and this girl admitted to buying $20 pineapple slices and it was only charged at such a high price because it was cut up and ready to eat. We tend to buy what is most convenient for us. I did not really acknowledge how much of a problem that was until now. 
            <br><br>
Also, the iPhone conversation is interesting as the producer is purposely making them glitch so people can buy a newer version. The fact that they keep adding more and better features is also interesting to think about because they keep producing so much because they know people will want it and buy it. 
            <br><br>
As for Kenos question I think the fault is that of the producer because they know how to sell a product and strategize a marketing ad so people could feel like they need more. Although, the argument can be made that people have the freedom to stop buying the products and they are not being forced to I still think it is sneaky of the companies to use this technique.


<br><hr>
When I hear that people buy pre packaged and sliced fruit that cost that much...I seriously have trouble understanding what compells people to spend that much on something that does not need packaging and does not need to cost that much. It really is so shocking to me that my jaw dropped when I read your comment. Convenience does have a cost, but I believe that convenience is also an extremely large factor of climate change. I agree with you that the iPhone conversation was interesting in that they are literally lying to people...big business repeatedly reveals how horrible their tactics are to get more money out of us, but yet we continue to support them. I believe this tactic is extremely sneaky

After reading "waste makers", I have a new view of consumerism. In today's American society, people's purchasing power is getting higher and higher because of the rapid increase in productivity and the quantity of commodity production. People's consumption far exceeds the level of demand. Most people pursue consumption quantity instead of quality. As a result, a large number of goods are wasted, and those that have just been purchased for less than one year are likely to be eliminated. This is not only a waste of resources but also great harm to the earth's environment, thus accelerating the pace of climate change. Even some manufacturers will shorten the service life of their products, such as mobile phones and computers. After a period of normal use, cell phones and computers will appear stuck. After that, the manufacturer will launch new products and attract people to buy them with some attractive advertisements and preferential policies. So a lot of resources are wasted. We should seriously think about what we really need and not let the desire to buy affect us. For the sake of personal interests and environmental protection, we should change this consumption concept.

Through my high school history classes, I was aware that America’s economy depended a lot on consumerism, but my teachers never really went into depth into how American consumer culture became this way.  I never really noticed that Americans were so obsessed with buying things.  I assumed that Americans bought things as often as people from other countries.  I am shocked that so much energy is spent making sure that Americans are constantly buying.
            <br><br>
This reading does not mention the environmental aspects of American consumer culture, but this type of spending definitely has horrible effects on the environment.  It is unfortunate that our economy has developed in such a way that attempting to make ourselves more environmentally friendly (for example by buying less stuff) will have negative effects on our economy.  It is even worse that our spending has to continue to increase as time passes in order to maintain our country. 
            <br><br>
Prior to reading this, I forgot about considering the economy when I thought about the climate crisis.  I could not understand why people were so unwilling to do things like make things more environmentally friendly, or promoting the sale of products that were long lasting over products that were cheaper but less durable.  I did not see why people would be against something that would help the planet, because even if they turned out to be right in saying climate change is not happening, what harm would there be in doing things that could help the planet?  Now I see that it is not solely because people refuse to believe in climate change, but it is easier to maintain the economy if we continue promoting excess consumerism.
            <br><br>
I am shocked at the methods that have been created in order to convince people to buy more.  I was especially surprised that the methods mentioned are still so effective today, like using the obsolescence of desirability in fashion.  A lot of people think nothing of buying things that are trendy because those items can usually be found for a low cost at stores like forever 21.  Because these pieces of clothing are not extremely expensive, people are willing to throw away the clothing when the trend is over.

This is why we need a plenitude economy. Stop focusing on the money and more on the people. Companies make people miserable and sell the hope of happiness to make money. Manipulate customers, claim it’s “patriotic”. “This is what you need to be happy”. Are you really? Working like Willy Loman, not seeing his family lots. Being a salesman, selling the products but also selling himself. Being in debt because he has to repair things that are barely paid off due to planned obsolescence. Chasing the newest trends to prove your worth. The pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired. Chase that ideal life that the companies sell to you. The items are not happiness themselves. We’ve put too much meaning into materialistic things. Shocking to see how accurate this reading is though. Congratulations: the companies have won. We now have two deodorants for men and women. We also have gendered shampoo, lotion, razors, conditioner, face wash, and even games. It’s not only bad for the environment but also society. Selling things that are bad for our health and pitching them as good, making people who don’t buy it feel insecure. “What kind of man actually pushes the lawnmower?” Ride it after a day of sitting at work! That’s how you know you’re successful!  Question everything you think is cool or good. It probably is sold to you buy companies trying to make money. Go Thoureau! What do you really need? That is what we need to ask ourselves.

your comment on consumerism is what I have in mind as well. The fast fashion industry is definitely one form of consumerism. The fast fashion trend, as well as the low-quality clothing, has generated a vicious cycle that is harmful to our environment. Nonetheless, consumerism does not only occur in making a purchase on clothing but also in other products. Furniture is another industry in which consumerism was applied. When we think of furniture, most of us immediately associate it with IKEA. Since 2008, IKEA has become the world’s largest furniture store and is responsible for approximately 1% of world commercial-product wood consumption. Every weekend, IKEA stores are all packed with consumers who are shopping for decorations and furniture to improve their homes. What makes IKEA so attractive is their’s stylish furniture and their unbelievable low price. In consequence, people are not guilty when they choose to throw away this inexpensive, low-quality furniture when they move out. This vicious cycle is exactly the same as in the fashion industry. Together, they have produced countless waste that pollutes our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree, I heard about the big consumerism culture, but I was not aware about how dependent our economy was to the fast pace growth of consumerism. It is worrisome to know that we have gotten to the point that our economy  would be greatly affected if we would try to lower consumerism to help the planet. I think it is important that gradual changes are made now to try to steer away from high consumerism being a main drive of our economy. I think people do not really stop and think, “oh I probably should not buy this I already have so much as home”,  especially when items are trending, on sale or at a low cost. I also think it is very sad that the companies are not truthful about the products durability when marketing just to make a lot of profit. The big companies are not putting the customer first or the well being of our planet. Not only does over producing goods constantly to make the most profits cause lots of damage to the environment for usually the gas emitted when they make the goods, but also the fact that they have promoted  obsolescence which leads to a lot more waste. I would also hope that celebrities and influencers could set a healthy example of  being more environmentally conscious instead of simply promoting to constantly buy more things to stay in trend. Yet it is everyone’s own responsibility to try to save our planet, which we are failing right now by getting caught up with this materialistic society.



<br><hr>
I agree with your comment as I was also unaware of how dependent our economy was on consumerism. Cars, clothing, home appliances, and furniture are all things that we all currently have yet companies are making more to sell to us. Our old things that are often times still in good conditions end up in landfills or back in developing countries. The reading mentions that in order for people in the 50's to be able to afford a car they had to work 53 hours more a month in order to afford an older version. Cars last a long time with their average lifespan being 11 years but the individual parts inside these cars need to be replaced every so often which emerged a new industry to replace these car parts. Fast fashion is also another problem in our country today. We have 52 seasons of different clothing that is sold in stores every year. From convincing people that they needed to match certain pieces together to us today feeling like we need certain brands of clothing. Advertisements are a main cause for why we feel the need to consume more. Advertisements today versus those of the 1900's are a bit different as today companies use social media influencers and famous people to try and sell their products, giving us the false idea that we will be cool if we buy these products.

Throughout these readings/films/lectures, I’ve also been having the same thoughts you have. I couldn’t really understand why people were so adamant on helping the environment. Hypothetically, even if climate change wasn’t real, we would all be living in a cleaner environment which could have potential health benefits for us. Overall, it would improve our ways of living. I see it as a win-win. However, after reading the Waste-makers, I understand that individual people are not the only thing at play in this problem. It’s kind of scary how much power these huge corporations have on politics and the economy. As I understand, the Waste-makers was written in the early 1960’s/late 950’s and sadly, it can still be applied today. These companies literally changed the culture and the cultural thought to make consumers feel like they NEED to buy more. As Packard details that companies use these techniques to induce people to buy more than one of each  product. One of the parts of the book that really stuck with me was when he created the distinction  between genuine Innovations and wasteful innovations. The wasteful innovations have taken the “novus” or new out of the word innovation. There is nothing new about creating the same phone, with the same features and functions, but making it a tiny bit bigger. We don’t really NEED to have multiple products in different color and sizes. That’s not innovation. Real innovations, made with genuine intentions (not just for profit), saves and betters peoples lives. Even in Packards time, Americans were consuming and discarding their products at high rates. I’m sure that hasn’t really changed. We’ve been so careless with the earth’s resources for so long because this idea of consumerism has been forced into our heads for so long. In a way, Americans have become desensitized. We make ourselves blind to what’s truly going on to create these  products. Fossil fuels are being burned at alarming rates, people  are forced to work in horrible conditions to make a less than livable wage, and the environment is slowly deteriorating.

I think that your point about perceiving America to be buying as much as other countries is a very common misconception that I myself have too. I think that Americans are typically very ignorant of our actions and simply assume that we are not doing any worse than anyone else and we use that as an excuse to act in any way we want. Before reading this, I also didn't think that Americans were necessarily obsessed with buying things simply because thats what we are so used to in this generation and we know no different. It doesn't seem bad to us because we can't see from an outside perspective how terrible our consumer economy truly is. I think it is also an issue in society because it is tough to make the connection between a change in the climate to buying things because they don't easily relate unless you know the science behind the making of the products. We tend to buy things without any consideration of how it got to be there, and just enjoy the accessibility we have to whatever we want whenever we want it. 
            <br><br>
I think the relationship between the state of the economy compared to the efforts taken to prevent climate change create a bit of a dilemma. Because of the way our economy has developed, buying things in mass amounts is generally what has kept our economy flowing. We need to change our mindset though and start considering all aspects involved and invent a new economy based around the more important things and change the way the whole world runs because the way it is right now is very one sided in favor of money and nothing else. We need to understand the tactics used against us to convince the population to buy more to support large companies and let the world suffer as a result.


<br><hr>
I agree with you on your frustration. The United States is a capitalist country and the number priority for a company is not to be environmentally friendly but to make the biggest profit as possible. Unfortunately these companies have seemingly have gotten so big that they’ve essentially bought our government to make any real climate change legalization. We might nibble around the edges but never tackle at the root of the climate crisis because not disturbing the economy is a bigger priority than our planet. It’s frustrating but we have to do whatever we can. Changing the consumer narrative will be hard because our entire society revolves around it but we’re gonna have to do whatever we can because the United States is causing a lot of the problems and we have the recourses to stop it whenever we can. We just have to change our culture and that’s something that’s gonna be difficult.




<br><hr>
I agree that this reading really opened my eyes to the degree to which companies will go in order to make a sale.  Through planned obsolescence and obsolescence of desirability, brands make customers feel as though they MUST purchase items.   For example, things like Iphones, everyone feels as if they must get the best and the newest, even if the one that they are currently using does them just fine.  I believe this to truly be based on advertisements, and societal pressure.  Not only are the companies themselves masters at manipulating and brainwashing people into thinking they need to buy something,  but there are all kinds of social pressures to keep "up to date" with your purchases as well.  Everything from technological items to clothing, there's always something bigger and better that you should be buying.  
            <br><br>


I also agree with you that it is easy to forget about how intertwined the environment and the economy are.  I believe a lot of our issues with environmental issues remain problems because people are so concerned with the fall of the economy.  Things like oil, people are afraid that they won't be making as much money.  Things like fashion, people are afraid they won't be making as much money, if no one buys clothes anymore, the economy will fail.  However, I find this nearly comical when we are quite literally destroying the planet, because if we continue in the way we are acting, there will be no earth to live on, and therefore no economy that exists.




<br><hr>
I agree with you. Fashion is very attractive to people, but in the long run, it can cause many environmental problems. The way people consume today is incorrect, and this is some companies and even governments are happy to see. Consumption can develop the economy, and in the eyes of most people, the economy is more important than the environment, and even more important than health. Smoking is very harmful to the human body, but tobacco is still selling well-the government will not ban products that bring huge economic benefits to the country.

I was particularly drawn to the economic idea that people must consume 4% more every year to support economic growth and avoid recession. Constantly increasing consumption makes waste inevitable. This highlights how at odds our economic and environmental goals can be. I recently read a New Yorker article exploring whether or not we can experience prosperity without growth. It did not reach a definitive answer but made compelling reasons both to support economic growth and also to slow down or change our growth. Packard does a great job of explaining the drivers of marketing and our economy. One of the benefits of economic growth explained in the article is that economic growth correlates with lowering poverty rates, but it seems that our systems are becoming increasingly unbalanced economically as the few richest have such an obscene amount of wealth. Packard’s explanation of planned obsolescence and the kinds of obsolescence made some of these distant seeming concepts feel very personal as it was easy to identify all three of the kinds with things that I consume. I want to better understand the ways that the economy will be affected by different solutions to the climate crisis and how our economy can shift to support growth but decrease waste.

It was interesting to learn that consumerism really began between WW1 and WW2, when people began to see more value in materialistic items. Additionally, I agreed that radical cultural change had a lot to do with increased consumerism. Once the status quo changes it is so easy to be done with the old and in with the new.

            <br><br>

Personally, fashion-wise I consider myself to be pretty unwavered in the face of trends and the latest and greatest. However, I am definitely not a prime example of only having what I need and reusing everything until it's not usable. Like Ken mentioned in a lecture this week, there is a type of spending that isn’t crazy shopping hauls, but is still detrimental to the environment. That is---I invest in various high quality items that are newer and keep those until I want another high quality item. For example, Patagonia synchilla pull-overs. I consider these to be worth the price tag because of their warmth, style, and life span--yet I’ll probably buy a new one every year or so. In short, while I do not tend to bounce from trend to trend, I do still buy things--the same things--continuously and not because I truly need them.

At first, I was expecting this book to be a dry, fact-filled research thesis speaking on the topic of how much Americans throw away. Instead, I felt much the same chills as I did when I read Huxley’s “Brave New World” or Orwell’s “1984”; feeling like it should be satire, but understanding the truth within the text. As someone who grew up in a consumer culture that is highly segregated, filled with obsolescence, and designed to push as much product into consumers’ homes as possible, it was eerie for me to read about the time that was Before: before the multicar home, before the multihome family, before women had a lipstick and “nail enamel” for every mood and fashion trends that could not be emulated with the wardrobe one already had. It seems so bizarre to me that Americans, as a whole, flipped from being frugal people who treated their possessions, even the most menial ones, as “heirlooms” as the author states, to a people whose lives had become “disposable.” And this flip only happened in 20 years! 
            <br><br>

Many of the strategies that Packard discussed are ingrained in American markets today. The flimsy products that require frequent replacements comes to mind. I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to replace a shirt or a sweater, not because I outgrew it, but because it ended up looking so ragged and threadbare after about a year of wear that I couldn’t even donate it. Additionally, the idea of obsolescence of desirability is rampant within Silicon Valley. I still use an iPhone 5, because it works. People find that so boggling. Isn’t it slow? Don’t you want a better camera? A larger screen? What about dark mode? In reality, I just need a smartphone. I can call and text, take photos, browse the web, and play music.. It isn’t fashionable, but I also try not to wrap up my identity in possessions the way I think most Americans unwittingly do.
            <br><br>

I also found the idea of gendered marketing (and its relatively recent introduction) to be mind-boggling, much the same way Packard did. Isn’t soap soap? And deodorant deodorant? And, in his time, an applicator an applicator? But when companies use the same active ingredients, change whatever asthma inducing fragrance included, and wrap it in a different colored plastic it’s somehow a different product? This applies beyond the influx of gendered consumer goods; when I looked at the ingredients on two cleaners I had, a disinfecting multi surface cleaner and a bathroom cleaner, the ingredients were exactly the same, between the disinfectant and its dilution, and the scents used, and the thickeners, and the surfactants and the amount of water. The two bottles contain the same product, but by convincing consumers that they need a different product for every conceivable situation, the company sells more. I had a teacher tell me in sixth grade that capitalism and consumer culture is freeing: it provides Americans with more choice. But now, when I go shopping, I’ve realized that it’s a false sense of freedom, when I pick between two laundry detergents with the same ingredients, when the cereal aisle amounts to boxes upon boxes of fortified wheat and sugar, when I’m asked to choose between 50 different toothpastes that are sodium laureth sulfate and fluoride and artificial peppermint in the same shape of plastic tube. When I walk on campus, I realize I’m wearing the same style of vintage inspired jeans and black Vans as every other girl. There is no freedom in American consumerism, just greater personal and planetary exploitation.

I felt the same way you did after reading several chapters of this book. It is terrifying yet unsurprising that American consumerism has brought to life Aldous Huxley's utopia that he envisioned in "Brave New World". As Packard points out, we have developed our own sleep indoctrination in the young through television ads constantly insisting them to buy new things, and once they get old to throw them away -- this vicious cycle of waste never ends. We live in a society where kids are taught that everything is replaceable, hence it is okay to throw stuff away if they are broken -- you can just buy a newer, better version when it comes out.
            <br><br>
The point you bring up about planned obsolescence and the iPhone is interesting because I remember reading an article about huge companies like Apple purposefully degrading older iPhone models in order to get people to trash their old phones for the newest one. The article pointed out that Apple introduced software updates that deliberately slowed these older models down, and they timed the update to coincide with the release of the newer model. Another prime example of this planned obsolescence is the removal of the headphone jack and introduction of the airpods. The sad reality is that it is simply a marketing strategy that is very effective in today's age of mass consumption and waste.

I find it somewhat fascinating how much the culture of consumerism has engulfed us. The fact that we have adopted this culture and make buying into it, literally and figuratively, a set social norm has me all the more frustrated once I look at how much in resources are expended. The realm of marketing has all the more influence in media since this is the main method of item promotion to consumers. The information that is shared in advertisements, or the lack of, have the ability to shape the way people view the environmental impact of the item for purchase and use. The methodology in which marketing is approached can oftentimes be a large target of scrutiny and questioning validity. We, as a whole, need to be more cautious of what hands our hard earned money will be placed into and mainly if we really need to fork over the green.

Packard describes a society with abnormal consumption norms in his book,  "the waste makers". People in the 1960s bought lots of stuff, and here is a word to depict the phenomenon which is consumerism. Consumerism represents people to buy things and discard them again and again. The norm took place not only because consumers become more greedy, but also because firms use strategy to force consumers to buy more stuff.  By changing their products from three aspects, quality, function, and desirability, firms can easily make consumers buy their goods more often than before. Firstly, they can make a small part of their product lifespan a little bit shorter, so people will have to buy new products since the old one is broken. Also, firms can apply new technology to new products which will motivate consumers to buy new products. Moreover, they can make the products seemed like outmoded after being used by people which can make the product less desirable, and people also will buy new products.
             <br><br>
    Firms are not the only reason that incense people to consume more, it also caused by government. The president, Eisenhower, who told people to buy more and discard them if the products are not that appealing. To maintain a hyperthyroid economy, government must coerce people to consumers more and more. However, lots of waste is accompanied with the policy. For instance, many disposable products come to the market and become popular which saves people's time of washing dishes and preparing food.  Furthermore, to earn money, firms reduce the lifespan of their products without telling people, and it results in a lot of waste. 
               <br><br>
  The norm, consumerism, is challenged by Thoreau who proposed minimalism. He advocated a simple life by having a few clothes and living in a small house. Furthermore, he maintained that we need to eat locally since imports will produce lots of CO2 emissions.

I think that what Vance Pachard did is significant for all people. Like the “Merchant of Doubt”, it is like revealing the tricks that the magicians are using to puzzle all the people. This is by no mean that we shouldn’t purchase or consume anymore. We need to consume the things we necessarily need. Don’t be tricked by the firms to consume more than what we need since there are already people who reveal the puzzles for us.

Greed is a horrible thing. I remember a fable story that my parents used to tell me. A camel saw that an ox has a beautiful horn, and the camel is jealous of it. The camel pray to the God that says he also wants a beautiful horn. God punished him because he is greedy that he can’t even see that he has a strong and beautiful body already, so god makes his big beautiful ear small. The camel’s descents will all have small ears. I think that this story has told us everything. Don’t be greedy and want everything. Start to find and notice the intrinsic value. Your greed will profoundly influence the future. Just like climate change, we wanted so much and took so much and polluted so much. We will influence future generations. The best thing we can do is to start to change and act. Put some positive impact in the future. This is not only for others but also for yourself since you will find your own value and prominence during this.

How to promote economic growth? It is easy to come up with ideas like more production, more consumption, global trade, etc. However, it is surprising that letting people waste more is the way many companies think of promoting economic development. Everything seemed to be crazy after Victor Lebow gave the idea about “forced consumption” in The Journal of Retailing in the 1950s, which gradually formed the strategy to make Americans greedy. I found it interesting when Vance Packard pointed out three ways of some companies to achieve the goal: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability. In my opinion, only one of these three, obsolescence of function, is commendable (or the advantages outweigh the disadvantages), because it promotes technological advancement and makes people's lives more convenient. The other two, however, usually followed by some bad consequences. For example, the obsolescence of quality： 1.makes buyers lose trust in technology and products；2.destroys engineers’ ability to create; 3. forms a kind of deception.
                <br><br>

In my experience, the third method, obsolescence of desirability, is the most common in today’s life. Taking iPhone as an example, Apple has a new generation every year, and sometimes they are not much better than the previous generation, maybe just a new look. However, whenever a new phone is released, even if people do not have any functional problems with their existing phones, most people will feel that their existing phones are out of date. There is an interesting joke I found on the internet: “There is no substantial improvement in this new generation of mobile phones. Why do you think people will snap it up?” “Come on! It is an iPhone! Everyone’s gonna love it!”
                <br><br>

“Once a radical cultural change has taken place, we often quickly adjust to the new normal. To people born into a changed era, it generally does not seem unusual at all, as it is all that they have ever known. The new normal is simply normal.” I appreciate these words by Ken in the video, and it is true. We are now in the middle of profound cultural change, so we can still see the changes clearly and react strongly (maybe some of us have already gotten used to it). If we do not correct the cultural form now, the future generations may treat it as a kind and tradition and follow it without a doubt.

 I also agree that the obsolescence of desirability is a method businesses and companies use that impact me the most. It is very tempting to purchase a ditch a technological product when the new one is inevitably released the following year. I have a theory that Apple holds back its products purposely to employ the tactics of obsolescence of quality and desirability. As you mentioned, every new generation of iPhone makes the older one feel less desirable because there are potentially “small” changes that seem like a big deal when you are the one who is missing out. In our current generation, everything is moving super fast and in order to stay relevant and to feel like you are being included is to buy into the consumer culture. We allow ourselves to be bent at the will of companies because of our desire to fit in. Therefore, I believe that the obsolescence of desirability is an effective way to get someone to buy into the consumer culture without them really realizing it. I also believe that Apple strategically releases “quality” upgrades in small scales every time to make us feel like we need the new generation simply because it has a “better” camera or “better” face recognition. Back when I used to own an iPhone 5s, I realized that my GPS, Bluetooth, and battery life had decreased significantly following the release of the iPhone 8. I was aware that my phone was old but had no desire to upgrade or to spend close to a thousand dollars to replace my perfectly functional phone. Seemingly out of nowhere, my phone would die in just an hour and I could not get anywhere with my GPS because the tracking was no longer functional. When I read the “Waste Makers,” I now know that this could have easily been tactics employed by engineers who programmed the phone to die after a certain amount of time. 
                 <br><br>
I also agree with your statement that we need to change our culture now before it is too late. We are currently transitioning into a consumer culture, but are still capable of seeing consequences of a consumer culture. Studies exist within the field of social science that show how the consumer culture developed and how we can prevent it from continuing, but the reality is that it is up to us. If we do not change our ways then the future generation will just follow in our footsteps. I do admit, however, that changing this consumer culture will not be an easy task. In America, “bigger equals better” is so prominent in our media, culture, and lifestyle that it will require our attentiveness to bring true change within our lives. The little things must be magnified. For example, we must be able to see in our lives all the ways companies will try to buy us into the consumer culture as listed in the “Waste Makers.”

In his writing of "The Waste Makers," Vance Packard forced me to re-examine things I had previously taken for granted about our consumerist culture. For example, in describing the competing economic outputs of the U.S and USSR during the 1950's, Packard states that  the U.S. was "already out producing Russia in consumer durables by at least twenty to one," but that the Russians "still managed to startle the world by sending a giant satellite around the moon." This is significant because in this case the U.S's obsession with producing more and more for its people to consume did not at all help it in being the first to conquer space. Rather, it was the USSR, a country much less focused on consumerism. The dichotomy of focus that existed between these two economic powers is very interesting to me, and I believe that it should force us to question why we care so much about always producing more, even if it doesn't improve our well-being as a country or get us any closer to accomplishing our goals. 
                 <br><br>

Responding more directly to Packard's writings on planned obsolescence,  there were several examples that drew my attention. First, I found it astonishing just how far-reaching this cultural norm is. For instance, Packard describes the use of  "disposable paper camping equipment, including tents and sleeping bags, for modern campers." The idea that someone would actually purchase disposable items for camping is simply absurd, as it is traditionally an activity that purposefully looks to minimize the need for excessive gear in order to maximize one's ability to reconnect with their surroundings in nature. In addition, Packard gives another example of a potato peeler company painting it's products "as much like a potato peeling as possible" in order to increase the chances that it is thrown away by the consumer. To me, this shows the bad faith in which many modern companies operate, as they will do anything to sell more to consumers, even tricking them if they have to. Tactics like these should show us that companies are largely at fault for our consumerist culture, as they don't even attempt to give consumers the chance to keep a product and rather just look for any chance they can to shorten a product's lifespan.

I agree with you that this piece was eye opening. Like you I had to reexamine my consumer habits from the standpoint that Packard wrote this book from. Like you mentioned, it is crazy how much we consume in disposables. I especially like the part when Packard brought up wrapping. The fact that the average American family spends somewhere around 500 dollars a year on packing should raise some red flags. 500 dollars on the things we carelessly throw away. If wrapping costs that much, think about how much we use in plastic utensils, paper plates, tissues and other goods that aren’t needed. Our culture has too much emphasis on producing than it does about helping our planet since we are still producing ridiculous amounts of things that are meant to be thrown away since that will cause us as the consumer to back out and buy more. I get it, I like new things, but it has become blatantly obvious through this piece by Packard that we are being manipulated as a society and it is unacceptable.
                 <br><br>

Companies should be ashamed. Their purpose to provide quality products that the public will want has been severely perverted into them overproducing items that fit a need or a want, but that have short lifespans. Like Packard said, I understand that many companies do produce the best product they can, but the fact that only a fraction of companies do this is alarming to me as a consumer. If more people were aware of how we are being manipulated by the fashion industry with their fashion cycles, and furniture producers with their intentional short lifespan products, we would be less likely to deal with it. The only opposition I can think is that people who know it would hurt our economy. The only question is what is worse, killing our planet or hurting our economy by not producing unneeded products.

I want a big car parked in the big garage of the massive house I live in. This is something I wanted as a kid, our society puts an insane amount of emphasis on having material goods. Even prestigious jobs in our society are only seen that way only because of the material wealth associated with these jobs. We are 'wastemakers' we consume stuff we` don't need we consume things we shouldn't consume and we are all guilty of it, not because we are depraved but because we can if any group of people was given the same opportunities to consume and build their life as we do ours they would do it.  Why? because it is easy, fun, rewarding in all the wrong ways we have to overcome society and our own lizard brain to become better people for the climate and environment.

While "The Waste Makers" was written 60 years ago, the concepts that are explained are just as relevant, or even more relevant, to consumer culture today. We can clearly see the power that corporations such as Apple or Amazon have over us. Apple, which has hit a net worth of one trillion dollars, practices the same strategies that are mentioned. Their phone batteries deteriorate every couple of years so consumers will be driven to buy the latest iPhone, every apple device has its own special charger, which alone makes millions in profit. In addition Apple was the first to remove the headphone jack from its phone. While Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers ridiculed the company for the change, they've since followed suit, since they realized that removing the headphone jack and selling accessories such as air-pods and dongles to replace them would make millions in profit. 

                 <br><br>

Even though we consumers are obviously aware of the way we're exploited for profit, its hard to complain. These companies make our lives more convenient and better -- isn't that the point of buying things, to make our lives better? Ever since I've had my air-pods, I've loved their simplicity and convenience, how they connect to my devices automatically and charge anywhere with a lifespan of ours. While "The Waste Makers" exploits the greed of corporations, going into the future, I think the greed of us consumers is just as important in changing our consumer culture for the better.

When I read this book, one statement shocked me: “Nearly two fifths of the things he owns that are not essential to his physical well-being.” It means people now are in the overconsumption of life. Vance Packard explains this phenomenon that in the 1950s, due to the expansion of manufacturing facilities and the "increasing efficiency" of American productivity, inventories of all goods increased, leading to greater consumption at the time. Those companies encourage people to buy more in order to earn more profit. However, they haven’t thought about the consequences after this behavior. Although our economies developed rapidly, our environment was also destroyed rapidly. Our uncontrolled consumption and production lead to the reduction of resources and the emission of pollution. Packard calls the three obsolescence: functional obsolescence, quality obsolescence, and desire obsolescence, all of which is what we are experiencing now. What we need to do is realize our necessity and true demand. More things do not mean better. And for those companies, they need to follow the market demand to produce and utilize resources. All of us should reduce waste from our daily consumptions and uses.

The quote “early two fifths of the things he owns that are not essential to his physical well-being,” also caught my attention me since it is crazy how way back in time, people would overconsumes things not realizing that instead of it doing good to him/her, it rather did harm to the world. Thanks to Packard’s reading, I now understand why the people of today are so obsessed with always buying the new trend. It almost seems a if it is a must. This way of thinking has history, we have evolved to think in such a way because of all the consumerism in the past. I feel like this book should be read by more people so that they can see the monster behind consumerism. I did not know how bad consumerism was till I read this book. I never knew there’s was definitions for things like obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality and obsolescence of desirability. I can certainly relate to all because my entire life I have seen how all three have played out in my life. In just never came to think that they were negative aspects of life. I think that in the end, the main message I was getting from Packard was just very simple, that as humans we are so obsessed with having so much that it blinds us from seeing how much harm we can do to out planet especially when that overconsumption leads to so much waste.

Our consumeristic society is being fed by our laziness, and we will only continue to feed it if we keep heading at the pace we are going. As long as there is a demand, there will ALWAYS be a supply; and if there is not, companies will fight to be the first to make one. Even products that have been around for decades are being constantly revised, improved, and reinvented in order to milk the most money out of us as possible. Take phones, for example. Apple has had dozens of models of iPhones, with new ones coming out every year. While a phone certainly does not need to be replaced every year, hundreds of thousands of people toss their “old” phone and replace it with a new one on a regular basis. Not only is this a costly endeavor, but think of all the WASTE that we are creating. And this is just one of the hundreds of examples; phones, computers, automobiles, TV’s, refrigerators, homes, clothing. People are constantly looking for the newest, “best” version of a material item that they can own, and are willing to work tirelessly to get it. And for what? For our own good, or to compete with other people? I believe the latter is far more likely. 
                  <br><br>

It is difficult enough to free yourself from the so-called “pleasures” of material items thanks to 
                 <br><br>
the foundations set in the past. But being CONSTANTLY bombarded with advertising on TV, billboards, news articles, the radio, social media, etc. certainly does not help this issue. It is difficult to become free when practically everything in our society is tailored to brainwash us into doing the exact opposite. 
                  <br><br>

I find it shocking yet somehow unsurprising that this book was written in the 1960’s. If I was to have read it with no context, I would be easily convinced that it was written in our generation. Why? Because little has changed; if anything, it has gotten far worse.  
                  <br><br>

Reading the list of slogans that were used in the past to promote consumerism made me ill; “buy, buy, buy; it’s your patriotic duty”, “buy your way to prosperity”, “buy now—the job you save may be your own”. No wonder that our society is as materialistic and consumeristic as it is today. When people of authority are urging you to buy things—any things— you’re probably going to do it.
                 <br><br>
We need to learn to “go back to the basics”. We need to re-learn to be okay with less, and we need to reinforce the idea that less is more. Less spending means more savings. Less spending is less working, meaning more free time. Less spending means less hassle, fewer worries, fewer obligations. What good has ever come from constantly striving for MORE? If we continue to engrain the idea that we have to buy more and live luxuriously in order to be happy, we will never, ever be happy. We have to live in the moment, focus on the present, and take the future as it comes. If we could all just live more simply, and reinforce the benefits of simple living, not only would the world be a happier place, but our climate would be happier too.

It is incredible what big companies would do for profit these days, planned obsolescence is found in every line of products, from cars to iPhones, apparel to even food. 
                 <br><br>

Apple has been claiming that all of their products are environmentally friendly and recyclable, even the new MacBook Air is made out of recycled aluminum. But they also have a yearly new iPhone program, as you pay a fee to join the program, you get to trade in your old iPhone every year to get the newest one for a cheap price. This almost sounds counter-intuitive. Profit wise, Apple is the biggest company on this planet. They are claiming to be Eco-friendly, but at the same time, they are encouraging their customers to join a program to produce more E-waste every year. All of that for the profit of a new phone sale. To me, Apple is a very cool company, having the world’s resources, able to create wonderful products that shake the whole market. AirPods are a great example, Apple is definitely the first to announce such a product, and it is indeed magical. But these tiny earphones are impossible to recycle. The battery is glued into the plastic stalk, all the electronics in the pod itself is integrated too well to be disassembled. Every month, Apple sells millions of these disposable earbuds to us. Is that okay? Maybe, but when every other company sees profit and pitch in with their own version of Bluetooth earbuds, it is too just much waste. 
                 <br><br>

We should make the most out of our electronic gadgets or buy used options.

In reading "The Waste Makers", I think about how the people surrounding me have come to believe that a constantly growing economy and as a result, consumerism, is an inherent good to society. It provides jobs and income to families, rewards innovation, and allows the people of today to enjoy luxuries that the generations that came before us could only dream about. But there are no free lunches, meaning that you cannot gain something from nothing, as everything has a cost. But what is the cost for a culture of constant consumerism? As evident in The Waste Makers, modern America has adopted a mindset of “out with the old, and in with the new.” What surprises me the most is that this has been a relatively recent development within our history, as I have always assumed that this mindset is innate to who we are and have always accepted the idea that more is better. However, how much is too much? Many people never seem to be satisfied with what they have, striving for greater and better until they burn out. What can it take for us to stop spreading this idea around? Personally, I’m not sure.

This might seem a little bit excessive, but I want to break down each chapter that I read from Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers. In chapter 2, the main focus on oversaturation in productivity in America had caused an imbalance in consumer ability. Even though consumption rate doubled since WWII, we still couldn’t keep up with the production speed. I was not surprised to learn that two of the five things we own are considered non-essential. In a typical household, décor might be something that can’t be left out to build that overall family atmosphere. However, do we really need a different hand towel for every holiday? 
                 <br><br>

In chapter 3, the author talked about how we have ritualized the act of purchasing and through it we could find spiritual and ego satisfactions. In my opinion, this factor could be fulfilled with non-material goods or ideologies such the practice of yoga or meditation. Even religious beliefs could help one find the right connection with the inner self. In chapter 4, the concept of there’s always extra room provides an excuse for manufacturers to put more products out in the market. They argue that one should match the color of what they’re wearing with their mood of the day. This way, it will encourage to buy more of the same product just in a different hue. 
                 <br><br>

In chapter 5, we are encouraged to ditch the old items instead of getting them fixed and prolonging their lifespans. I find the statement discussing how no one could locate the rolls of scotch tape in a normal household super relevant to everyone including me. I know when my mom goes to the score, she buys at least an 8-pack scotch tape if not more because that is the least amount you could find. Stores usually want their customers to buy things in bulk, telling us that we are saving more this way. Most of the time, I think they are right, but the question is how did our society end up like this? Why are we forced to purchase items in large quantity in order to “get the better deal”? Part of me knows the answer is the seller is trying to sell us more so they could profit from the marginal cost. Could we ever reverse this tactic? 
                 <br><br>

The last two chapters focused on obsolescence: when things are outdated, we need to upgrade them. This mentality has conquered almost all industries out there. The first example I thought of was my phone. These phone contracts that we have encourage us to get a new phone every two years. They call it “trading in,” but why trade in a phone that still works perfectly fine. Ah… because everyone has the newest iPhone so obviously, I’m going to need one too. As sarcastic as that sounds, that’s the truth. This scenario also applies to people that lease cars. It’s difficult to shift our views to understand that we don’t need to the newest model in everything. However, some people could argue that it costs more to repair the old than to just buy a brand new version.

The Waste Makers includes a lot of information that would make big corporations very angry. With the three tactics that Packard explains in the text, corporations and their marketers can trick consumers into thinking that they need their products. I think the one that I am most familiar with is how producers "upgrade" an old product and sell it as new again. This is very obviously done with phones. Apple is known for coming out with a new upgrade of the iPhone or iPad every year, marketing it as something new and improved, even if the improvements are minimal. Since people are determined to have the best thing that is currently on the market, they keep consuming these products that they do not really need. Apple was accused of slowing down older versions of the iPhone so that consumers would buy the newest iPhone. iPhones and a lot of other smartphones are not built to last a very long time, breaking down over a two year lifespan until the consumer decides that it no longer works for their liking and goes for the new one that came out that year. I remember, when the iPhone11 was released, Apple released the preview for what the iPhone12 might look like very soon after. At this point, even I am confused by which one we are on and sometimes I forget what iPhone I have because they all basically look and work the same way. 
                 <br><br>
Consumerism is leading to the downfall of the wellbeing of Earth and is continuously tricking people into buying new products that they do not need. I think it would be much more exciting if upgrades for products were done every few years, not every year, plus it would probably cut back on the amount of waste that people produce. Companies may be afraid of losing their following, but if they created products that actually worked well enough to last years, were reliable, and had significant improvements from earlier generations, I believe that they would be able to keep their following. 
                 <br><br>
This is pointing most of the blame to the companies releasing these products, but this also falls into the hands of the consumer as well. I don't believe that it is a hard concept to understand: stop buying so much stuff that you do not need. This falls into line with what the Minimalists argued about only having things that improve the quality of your life. When shopping, think about whether what your buying will be worth the environmental damage that it will cause when you throw it away later. Also, try to make the things you own last longer, that way, you aren't throwing things out as often, nor will you be throwing out as much. If the demand from consumers goes down, so will the supply from companies, changing how the economy works. We can't let people with power from money take control of how our society works.

Before reading, The Waste Makers , I was unaware that there is a need to increase consumerism even more given that I see people always in stores constantly buying many things that are luxury goods or non-essentials. It’s shocking that the economy depends on consumerism increasing each year. It mentions that major companies are losing potential output that it could be producing, because there aren't enough consumers to buy the goods. It is interesting because major companies are just thinking of increasing their output to make a lot more profit instead of adjusting to the current consumerism and lowering permanently. Since overproduction of goods we do not need leads to more waste and emission of greenhouse gases. I do not think they are losing profit if they choose to stop overproducing and produce at a lower rate. It is interesting the idea that is brought up about how companies, like Apple, are always bringing new products out, but not necessarily with a lot of improvement, just a different look to attract the attention of consumers. I agree, I think at this point many  have few adjustments made and the look changes a bit and market it to make it seem that you need this expensive modern item. Social media plays a big role in this, since people consistently are posting about new things whether paid or sponsored by companies or not, it pressures people into believing they need this item when they do not really. 
                 <br><br>

I had heard about the idea that companies made products so that after a while they do not work as well so you will buy a new one, but having if confirmed by the article is surprising. After all when companies like Apple promote their products they say they are providing high quality products which sometimes is not necessarily true. I remember back when the earlier models of the iphone were out, I had an iphone that I had to replace rather soon since it began getting slow despite never having been damaged in any way. It’s concerning that companies are doing this and advertising their products are high quality. I think society and social media has to get away from the idea of popularizing obsolescence, because that leads to more waste. As for companies making lots of profit of obsolescence, I think it is important that people get more informed of what companies are actually doing instead of getting caught up on what is trending and wasting money on things they do not necessarily need.

After reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, my fears about consumer culture and its producers were true. They produce and sell things only to be hyped up, desired, guilt customers into purchasing it, and making sure that the product is cheap and incapable of being used for a prolonged amount of time. They tell us that it's necessary to buy more even if you can't afford to. If you can't afford to, you need to work hard enough to be able to buy more. Moreover, once you have bought that new sneaker or handbag, you still aren't satisfied. The new model or style, with little innovation besides a different color or pattern, comes out the following season. The text does a good job of going over the history of how we have come to value purchasing more and more as part of the American dream. It has been embedded into our lifestyles and very economy. We kill the planet in order to satisfy temporary desires and to fuel the profits of the elite. "Planned obsolescence" has become the tool of the few powerful producers to facilitate a toxic consumer culture that makes people define themselves and their successes by the material things they own, with this idea of success and fortune being an illusory thing that can never be reached because there is always the next new thing.

I completely agree with the points you made and it deeply saddens me that this has become the established routine of consumer culture. Your comment about needing to work more just to afford to buy certain things resonated with me because of how unfortunately true it is. People get sucked into this endless cycle of working to buy and consequently being unfulfilled and depressed just to leave a few people at the top making the most money, and even then those extremely wealthy people may be unhappy themselves because they’re placing value in money alone. I’ve been exposed to the reality of these destructive habits before, but this class definitely reminds me that there is so much more to live for. Where’s the joy in working just to buy a house that will be filled with stuff you don’t need? It sounds terribly shallow to me. Even as I hold these values that are not focused on the chase of buying things, I still have to work to keep them grounded because of the rampant and invasive marketing strategies that we are vulnerable to every day.

While reading “The Waste Makers” I was deeply interested by the role of consumerism in the economy of the US. One thing that shocked me while I was reading these chapters was that in the near future, average American citizens must increase their consumption by nearly 50 percent or else the economy will “sicken.” I have always known that consumerism is a big part of everyday life and big advertisements are constantly encouraging customers to buy goods, but I was surprised to learn that in order to push consumers to purchase more goods, companies work to create obsolescence of function, quality, as well as desirability. I think that it is important to note that companies such as Apple manipulate consumers into becoming waste makers by affectively convincing people to spend large quantities of money on new and improved products that are actually marginal upgrades from their previous gadget. I also found the section about the “death dates” of products very interesting. Not only will death dating create more waste, but it will cause distrust between consumers and companies, will “kill” engineers creativity, and cheat consumers out of their money. Another example of the deception that companies try to create is that of the aerosol can of chocolate that the author talks about in Chapter 5. This example demonstrates that companies are creating products solely to become or be perceived as useless after a short period of time in order to create more sales and to turn consumers into wasteful beings. This development of wasteful consumer culture scares me because although many people may be aware of the deceit that companies try to put on consumers, we all still fall victim to the advertisements and trends of retail, automobile, and many other industries who try to convince us that we need more of everything and that our hunger for goods and services will never be satiated.

In addition to creating a climate of desirability around certain products, I feel that companies ave also created this illusion of dependency.  Growing up, my first cell phone was my mom's old AT&T brand flip phone that could call her and my dad's phone.  Soon after, iPhones became much more relevant and my mom got the iPhone 4.  Within a matter of years, we all had one and we were almost completely dependent on them.  While we had lived almost our entire lives without a smart phone, Apple created the illusion that we needed them to survive and to thrive.  They continue to do this, with the new generations being introduced every couple of years that are seemingly identical to the previous, with a few obsolete differences.


<br><hr>

My family actually has pretty much the same history of buying phones. Sometimes I think about how recent it actually was that iPhones were uncommon, let alone the standard for every person in the country. Part of me knows I could survive without a smartphone, but at the same time, it seems incredibly difficult to not have an iPhone when every person in my life does. All the features Apple has added, like blue vs. green text, emojis that only show up on Apple devices, different chargers, etc., make it difficult to be the only one without one of their products. I wish it were easier to opt out of our consumer society, but at this point it seems impossible.

This piece either seems very ahead of its time or we are extremely behind in ours. The fact that this was written in the 1960s and mentions that there were more passenger cars than people in that time is in sane. What are the statistics for that now? I'm sure there are lots more at this point. Also the author explains the horrible consumerist cycle that keeps business making insanely high profits and promoting over consumption. If a producer wants to stay in business, if everyone already owns their product, they either have to sell replacements, sell more than one to each family, or sell a new idea, a better version of your product. If the product has been around for years, the idea of creating new and improved products can be hard to think up. Our consumer society is driven by for profit corporations, and this phenomenon has gotten so extreme, as shown in Hassan Minhaj's fast fashion episode.

The Waste Makers really opened my eyes to how materialistic America as a nation is. As stated in the film Minimalism people are now defined by the products they own rather than what they achieve or what they do. This reading explained why that is, and gave the history of the post-world war II industrial and economic boom, as well as the government encouraging the citizens to buy more products. Thus, resulting in a wasteful population and the mentality of people treating all items as replaceable. I found that the most intriguing because we often discuss that American mentality but I never knew how that came to be. 
                 <br><br>
I have been aware of the planned obsolescence for a while now, and understand how companies need that to stay in business, but personally, my immigrant family is not really affected by it unless it is appliances. Unless something is truly broken and unusable my parents will not buy a new item. I believe this is truly a first world and American idea to throw something out once it is out of style, or something better and with more efficiency comes out into the market. I am glad that their mentality rubbed off on me instead of the wasteful American one that one should always want the best thing available. I was raised on hand me down clothes from my cousins, I have witnessed appliances in our house be used until broken down, and have seen my mom use torn up clothes as rags instead of just throw them away. I too do not shop often, and use electronics and such till they are truly broken, to just throw it out and buy the next item is super wasteful in my opinion. I was shocked the first time I met people who just toss away their belonging like nothing. I if the way I think is because my family is from a third world and developing country, and because I have seen them struggle for most of their lives, but now even when they are living comfortably they still are not wasteful. I am glad for the way I was raised and that I did not pick up on this habit.

"Making Waste" is an interesting book introducing how companies use strategies to convince people purchase things that they do not actually need. The book mentions that engineering departments in a company now serve as 'sale' as well since they have to invent, or just make products seem to be different from the last generation to persuade people purchasing it again, but in fact the main function of the products did not change. Consumers do want to buy more, and companies job is to convince they the new products is 'different' or more advanced so they can earn money from it. If we think it deeply, we can see the relationship with our daily life. 
                 <br><br>

For example, nowadays almost everyone use iPhone, and since iPhone 1 was created more than 10 years ago, we now have iPhone 11, and yes there probably is a huge difference between 1 and 11, but if we compare the newest generation with the one published three or four years ago, we can tell that the main function stay the same and most of the developed technology seems to be meaningless for most of us. So why people still want to purchase? Probably it is our wish to spend money, to buy things, to compare with others, and thus we are making waste of this planet, thoughtlessly putting more burden on our Earth. This several chapters not only teach me strategies business might use to attract consumers, but also remind me that we have to think carefully that if the thing we bought is really necessary before we purchase.

I completely agree with your thoughts on this reading. While reading these chapters I also found myself thinking about Apple products and how almost everyone owns an iPhone or a Macbook or both, usually the newest models. I thought this reading was very interesting and thought provoking. It really made me think about how we are all continuously manipulated by consumerism and we were taught that we always need the next best thing. This is very frustrating because it would be very difficult for all of us to suddenly stop buying into this materialistic mindset. The sad fact is that this lifestyle is ingrained in all of our minds and for us to change this idealism of wanting new everything all of the time would be incredibly challenging.

I have always known that consumerism and productivity are essential to the economy. After all, one of the major factors that got us out of the Great Depression was WW2, when every single facility was used to make tanks and bombs;  when women joined the workforce to produce because the men were off to fight. There was a crucial need for "stuff", not only just to feed Americans but Europe as well (Allies at least), and thus the American productivity was at its peak. This movement revitalized the economy and pulled us out of the Depression. With this example in mind, I have always thought that consuming is good, for not only the consumers get what they want, they also benefit the economy by paying more and keep the flow of cash going. That was until I read "The Waste Makers" and realize that with each consumption, there is a waste product that goes along with it. Unfortunately, there are many people that have the same mentality as I did who aren't exposed to this book. Their only goal is to keep the economy moving, nevermind the consequences. Packard really made this clear when he showed examples of how companies tried to sell the idea that each family requires 2 refrigerators, multiple cars, 2 homes...etc, trying to standardized a high consumerism culture so people are forced to buy more products. The same goes for fashion: multiple trends per year for each season or multiple variations of the same item each with a slightly different purpose. These business tactics are in place to force consumers to buy if they want to stay in trend with society and not be an outcast. What really surprised me from this book though was how producing companies sometimes purposely make their products not as good as it should be in order to sell more products throughout the year. I kinda felt a little betrayed because you would think that you are paying for the worth of the item (that was best produced for its price), but in reality, the item is of lower quality on purpose because those companies want you to come back when the item breaks. Not only is that bad for the consumer, but it is also bad for the environment, as well. I think these producers are way too focused on supporting the economy that they forget that the economy is supposed to be supporting us.

In "Waste Makers", Vance Packard lays out the manipulative sales tactics used by the automobile, fashion and house supply industries, as well as many others. It was shocking to read that hundreds of corporations had gone to such lengths simply to make more money. I have often heard that companies, today, implement measures to make their products fall apart or wear out earlier. Apple slows down battery function of older phone models once they release a new model and some companies use cheap materials to ensure that their product will break sooner rather than later. These make the consumer more likely to buy another product sooner than they would have if the product was made following normal standards. So, when I heard that this practice has been happening since the first half of the 20th century, I began to feel a bit cynical. How can corporations be allowed to do this for almost a century and face no negative consequences?
                 <br><br>

Beyond the obvious problems of consumer manipulation, this trend of constantly repurchasing and getting rid of products causes severe environmental damage. The more we buy, the more is thrown away. This means landfills fill up quicker and production plants are producing more, which leads to more CO2 emissions in a smaller period of time. Single-use products and products with purposely reduced shelf-lives are everywhere and consumers are manipulated into ignoring the consequences. We have been helping corporations facilitate the climate crisis for decades and the only positive is that these corporations are making more money. Moreover, because we can not see that corporations are manipulating us with "trends" and convenient single-use items, it could be awhile before this style of consumerism is eradicated.

As I read waste makers, I was surprised to hear that buying is actually driven from a political perspective. I understand that purchase / production can promote the economy, but at what cost. The company is so eager to bring their products to the market that they constantly create "new" products, although this is not too different from the past four products. With the advent of new modern products, the products we already have begin to look old, so we feel belittled and judged. Let's take the car as an example. Except for electric vehicles (because I don't think they are classified as cars), basically all the cars are only equipped with some new configurations when they are replaced, such as adding some touch-screen auxiliary brakes, automatic parking, automatic driving, and other latest technologies, but the nature of the car is not convenient, and some manufacturers won't even give it to themselves for many years The same series of models upgrade the chassis and engine, because the cost of developing these things is huge. Although these latest generation cars are essentially the same as their predecessors, people are still more inclined to new models, because they have updated appearance and technology. When people abandon their old cars for new ones, the economy is driven, but at the same time they don't realize the impact on the environment when they buy new products. I think in the future, when you buy your favorite car, you should also consider the environmental cost.

This week’s reading reminded me of the reasons why I switched from a business marketing major to an English major. I didn’t want to “brainwash” consumers into buying things they did not need and more importantly, I didn’t want to encourage consumers to feel bad, guilty, or think of themselves as less than for not acquiring a new item. Vance Packard takes a deep dive into the toxic history and origin of modern-day consumerism and as many other students, I’m not the least bit surprised, but I am upset that these marketing schemes have been so heavily established that it is our normal. I (along with all other students in this class) was born into this destructive and dangerous pattern of endless and mindless buying, so we’ve truly never known anything different. Ironically, we’re the ones who are now trying to find ways out of this societal conditioning to desire more and better things. Admittedly, I can completely understand why businesses and corporations have adopted ways to trick American consumers into continuing to buy and replace their material items. They are operating for profit after all, even if the best interest of their customers is not at all on their minds. While reading these chapters from The Waste Makers I wondered what solutions there are that could benefit both parties. How could businesses continue to make money and sell products without harming the environment and their customers? Even if customers believe they are being benefited by acquiring the latest and greatest model of whatever kitchen appliance or the most trendy shoes, in reality, they are actually gradually degrading their mental health and getting further away from the true quality of life. 

                 <br><br>

My aunt is definitely a victim, if you will, of toxic consumerism and although buyers make the willing decision to buy things, I believe the marketing plays a huge role in planting the seed of desire to consume. At this point, she’s a borderline hoarder and as the reading suggests, she has so much stuff in her home it’s difficult to locate where things are. She literally bought an Apple watch just in case she can’t find her phone in her own home (I guess there’s a feature where you can ping your phone to easily locate it, I wouldn’t know I don’t have an Apple watch). 

                 <br><br>

Overall, the realities of these industries are extremely upsetting and frustrating to think about because many people don’t realize that once you throw something away, there is no “away”. Things don’t just disintegrate, they end up in the landfills, oceans, or on the side of the road. It’s easy to become pessimistic when it seems that individuals like us are powerless and don’t have a say in how these industries operate, but I hope that we can touch on solutions in class with Ken. I know that on a small scale we can “vote with our dollar” and personally discontinue buying unsustainable goods for unnecessary reasons. Most of us have our basic needs met, so what else can we really need? No matter how much you feel like you need something, if you have food to eat, a roof over your head, and essential clothes to wear, you really don’t need anything else. At that point, you simply want it either for convenience, status, or luxury.

I did not really think of how business people feel about what they are doing now. In Packard's chapter 6 or 7, it is mentioned how manufacturers began to feel bad and also felt their reputation were at stake at well. Reading how you changed your major because of possible guilt etc. is interesting and surprising because I feel like in today's age no one cares about others as long as it means money. I feel like movies show the ruthless business person or CEO who cares little of people as long as they sell their product or make money. Your comment about brainwashing really interested me. 
                 <br><br>

In terms of your 2nd paragraph, I also relate. Reading Packard's book and thinking of how things go out of style and use so quickly just reminds me of how much stuff we collect or leave to collect as we continue to buy new things. Overall, while reading Packard's, it just made me think about how much worse it is now. Lots of quotes from the reading surprised me and saddened me when thinking about how this is the way consumerism runs and sadly succeeds.


<br><hr>
I also have many people in my life who, like your aunt, are victims of this consumer culture. One common trend I noticed with those people who buy whatever the next product that Apple or Sony advertises or the next overpriced trench coat Calvin Klein releases is that they tend to come from less financially stable backgrounds. My friend back home, for example, came from a large family that lived off welfare for several years at many points in his life. Now, he works part time while studying to pay off his family’s bills. He uses the little excess money he earns to spurge off the latest Apple products, buying the next iphone or smart watch the minute it’s released. Plus, he refuses to buy clothing that’s less than designer. There are so many people I’ve noticed who follow this trend. Meanwhile, other people in my life who are more financially privileged fall back to the “reduce, reuse, recycle” lifestyle, eating vegan and thrifting whenever possible. I think this goes back to the whole “you are only as successful as the things you own” mindset that many older generations have. People who are victims of advertisements are simply trying their best to be seen as a higher “status” by seeming well-off economically.

I had had light conversation sin the past about tactics that companies use to get more people to buy their stuff. I did not quite understand how normalized and terrible that it actually is. "The Waste Makers" was eye opening to say the least. I am angry at the way corporations a so fine with making lesser products so that they will get their customers coming back. Quantity is placed far higher than quantity. Apple Iphones keep coming to mind. Apple coms out with a new phone constantly. For many people, they need the latest and greatest. For other people who can afford it or who are fine with their current phone, We stick with a later model. The problem with that is apple will keep coming out with new updates. Hidden in these new updates, is junk that is intended upon targeting the older models and making them slower in performance. Whether it be speed, battery life, or anything else, the phones start losing their functionality. Thus consumers are forced to upgrade to the newer phone and start the cycle back up again. It is frustrating knowing that cars have scheduled break down point just to get some part put in and then break again and then eventually ave to get a new car. This is a terrible tactic and the reading opened my eyes mush more to trends I find myself falling into.

I think it is important to address the relationship between the consumer and the producer when reading something like this. It can be very easy to demonize the producers of goods without asking the question: “wait, why did I just buy it?”
                 <br><br>

A lot of large corporations favor monetary success over the health of their surroundings. This is a sensible train of thought, as it is a corporation's job to raise as much money as they can, and increase profits. In fact, they have contracts signed with their shareholders that requires them to increase profit margins as much as possible. This being said, you can’t make money selling something if nobody is buying it. As for Ken’s question at the end of his video, I think it is on the consumer to regulate the producers. While it can be a challenge to sort through the mountain of consumer goods presented to us everyday and find out which ones we truly want/need vs. the ones that are just popular in modern culture, doing so will narrow down the market and drive it towards a more simple state. It will cut back on the ability of larger companies to produce all kinds of wasteful consumer products. 
                 <br><br>

For example, the Camel Cigarette company Ken mentioned did a very good job in targeting future consumers, trying to get them to join the “smoking club”. While this is a dirty tactic, selling poisonous sticks to young people, it should not be a tactic that works. As consumers in a capitalist economy,we should be able to sway products like these off of the market by not purchasing them. As supply goes up, and the demand we place on it goes down, the corporations will have no ability to make profit, forcing them to slow down production to maximize their profits. (Unsold surplus is lost money) I think it is on the consumers to regulate the products that we see and don’t see in the marketplace.

What I am most surprised about, reading through this book, is that this process has been going on for so long. The 60s-- the 60s! Saying things that would rightfully brand someone a socialist today, back then being no more than annoyed and prescient ranting about the new state of society. I wonder what could've been done to stop this before it became ubiquitous... I wonder if we could have avoided our fate at all. Really, it does make sense. America as an economic superpower, finally weaning off the postwar boom, desperately searching for something new to create and make and therefore needing more and more people to buy and buy. These businesses would never have voluntarily given up their grand manufacturing advantage, nor can I imagine that the politics of the era would have allowed even the suggestion of lowering the American GDP for the sake of consumerism. Buying is, as said, good for the economy. There is a reason Ike said to buy and buy anything. And in a capitalist behemoth, to create economic value and GDP comes before all else. 
                 <br><br>

I don't see history as potentially going differently. I don't see the baby boomers as possibly being able to resist the temptation of overproduction, overconsumption, overcreation. But I can see that the tides are turning, and that we genuinely have a chance. We are exhausted of things, having seen the last half-century of what true consumerism has done to us. We are exhausted of production, and hold little to no attachment to manufacturing anymore. We are disgusted by the tiny plastic baubles we consume and buy, and seem to be slowly weaning ourselves off of them. There is a genuine chance, here, for something better. It is not guaranteed, but it is a chance. 
                 <br><br>

The biggest problems that I see, honestly, are fast fashion and disposable packaging. Obviously, civilization can exist without them, but... damn, is it hard to imagine. I'm not sure I can even conceptualize it. It is a very obvious fact that plastic packaging has not always existed, yet I literally do not know how I'd buy groceries otherwise. I damn hope other people are more creative than I am.

I agree with you on a bunch of things you said here.  Mainly that although we are slowly weaning ourselves off of these disposable, overproduced and over marketed goods, there will still be a few wasteful elements of our culture that will be particularly hard to replace.  As much as we can try and buy larger goods that will actually last us a long time there isn't an obvious solution to things like food packaging where if we want to get a desired brand of food, the disposable packaging is coming with it.  With fashion I still have hope that we can return to not needing to stay up with current trends all the time in order to appear presentable.  It just makes so much sense to buy clothes that we like and will last us than it does to change out our entire wardrobe practically yearly to stay in style.

It also amazed me that this book was published in the 1960's.  That's 60 years ago, over half a century or basically my fathers entire lifetime.  Yet even with how long ago it was written and how far we've come, so many of the things talked about ring as true now as I'm sure they did back then.  The part about the Detroit auto industry was a particularly interesting section to me.  Hearing how the wealth of the whole city was based on this industry of constantly pumping out newer, bigger and "better" cars, yet eventually the consumers came out of the daze and were really wanting for it to be socially acceptable to scale down to a smaller more efficient vehicle.  When that happened the foreign auto market took over and the rest is history.  I have always heard of Detroit as one of the poorest cities in America, way behind most other cities in terms of average living conditions and general infrastructure.  But to hear a report of why it happened, written as it was happening, was very interesting to say the least.  And just as the over abundance of the auto industry eventually failed Detroit, it isn't much of a stretch to say the over abundance in the rest of our consumer lives will eventually fail the country as a whole.

Consumerism is at an all-time high in present-day with the rise in online shopping, delivery services, subscription services, and availability of stores. While obsolescence can allow for the advancement of a technology with the development of a product over time to ensure it reaches its full potential, companies have been only slowly improving products to encourage consumerism, materialism, and obsession with brands. In my opinion, one of the greatest examples of this is with the brand Apple. Apple has developed a sort of "fan base" and become a status symbol derived from an overwhelming desire to have the latest Macbook, Apple Watch, iPhone, and Air Pods. The company is also notorious for planned obsolescence and obsolescence of desirability, as detailed in The Waste Makers, that contribute to their products’ popularity. Even given their high prices and that most people know their iPhone will slowly lose battery life and storage space within a couple of years of purchasing it, almost rendering it useless and forcing them to upgrade, Apple still dominates the smartphone and tablet industry. Just in my own lifetime, I've owned the first, fifth, seventh, and tenth iPhones and have seen each break down as newer, better-looking models get released. As far as improving quality with each item, it's shocking to me how popular each new release becomes as Apple just tends to make minor tweaks to old products, such as a third camera or in-app features.

I think Vance Packard's classic 1960 study of consumerism, "the Waste Makers" greatly explains why consumerism becomes the major cause of climate change and climate disaster. Packard points out a great point about consumerism, that consumerism is a social issue and which is a fashion. After WWII, consumerism become a major idea among the American. People started to spend more and save less. And government support this kind of behavior, as consumption is the biggest part of formatting GDP growth. In 2018, 69% of GDP growth is consumption expenditure. If the government wants a good GDP growth, they have to push personal spending. More spending means more growth in the economy. Also, consumerism is one of the major reasons why the American economy grows so fast in the past few decades. Therefore, we should get a balance between growth in the economy and environment protection. For example, we should buy one thing less or one used thing per year, that already can make a big difference. If we do that, each year, the CO2 gases we reduced a year equal to half of the millions of cars using for a year. That is a lot. So we should try it.

It was interesting to see the reasons behind how we turned into such a consumerist society post world war II. In order for our economy to continue growing, Americans had to consume 4 percent more than it did the previous year in order to not go into recession. Instead of cutting down on production, industries and the government turned their efforts into convincing Americans they need more and the best solution to the problem is to buy. During this time consumption was two times greater than it was during the war and ⅖ of people’s products were not essential to living. I can’t even imagine how much consumption is up now and how disgusted Packard would be with our current status. 
                 <br><br>

However, while it is important to hold the consumers responsible it is even more important to hold the marketers responsible for brainwashing the way America views materials. Companies were so desperate to keep making profits that they had to make their products obsolete so that people would keep coming back to buy more. They wanted to create “strategies that would make Americans in large numbers into voracious, wasteful, compulsive consumers.” They convinced consumers in order to show your wealth and to keep up with the trends you constantly need to be buying more and buying new things. The goal of fashion was to make consumers unhappy with their current products, even though new products were being put into the market weren’t any better they just acquitted new with better. One thing that was crazy to me was how willing people were to give up their time and money for a “better car”. People would work an extra 53 hours longer just to afford a seemingly nicer car, even though this car got worse gas mileage causing the oil industry to gain even more power. Another story that made me furious was how the Holland Furnace Company would come to houses pretending to be government furnace inspectors and dismantle furnaces so that consumers would have to get new ones. 
                 <br><br>

Due to company’s desires to make their products obsolete, products are made purposefully to only last a certain amount of time. This reminds me of Apple and how they purposely make their phones only work for a certain amount of time so that people need to buy the new ones. They have society wrapped around their finger, because they have convinced the public that we need to have their newest and latest products. As consumers we need to open our eyes and realize the control major companies have on our lives and focus on buying only what we need.

The Waste Makers shocked me upon finishing the read, as the article contained so much concerning how much we have done to our planet in such a small amount of time that at first it didn’t seem to be believable. What really had an impact in the read, however, was that it didn’t just list out the negative aspects and practices of our society (such as the fact that we, Americans, now average twice as much consumption as we did in World War Two), but that Vance Packard offers forward detailed descriptions of these practices so us, the readers, are able to understand how we should be changing our lives to make them become  more environmentally friendly ways of living. The concept of Say’s Law interested me heavily, as this was my first encounter with the idea. The fact that both parties called for more growth is the start of our problem, as more growth means more consumption, and more consumption means cheaper production methods and more waste (both of which are destroying our environment). This call for more growth helped me understand where Say’s Law comes from, as it states that people will eagerly consume anything their nation produces for them. BY calling for more growth, this rapid consumption began a CO2 disaster, considering that from this point until now we have put 100ppm more CO2 in the atmosphere. This call for growth wasn’t the only thing, however, as the “There’s always room for more campaign” also played a role in making this waste. BY encouraging people to participate in this obsolescence and always desire the newest, most in style trend is a scam created by corporations to continue making money by producing practically the same objects. Once people, especially Americans, stop caring about what people think and how they present themselves, this unnecessary purchase phenomenon will finally end as will hopefully occur to the mass amounts of CO2 we are producing. I just pray our generation has the willpower to do this before it is too late.

After reading the waste makers I was shocked to see how big corporations have manipulated product to have a shorter shelf life which ends up contributing to a mountain of thrown out clothes. Big companies like those in the fashion industry have been creating low quality products in hopes that the consumers throw it away and buy the new and in style version. From this, millions upon millions of pieces of clothing are being created, worn and thrown out at an alarming rate. Consumption in the US is too high compared to that of other countries and they pay the price for it as well. If we don’t enact change then the fast fashion industry will continue to exponentially grow and our CO2 emission along with it. On average an American buys up to 60 pieces of clothing a year. What’s worse is that this is just a piece of their consumption. Consumers are targeted everyday by big cooperation in a quest to get people to buy more than what they need. Companies like Apple are accused of making their product’s shelf life younger and younger with each upgrade. Ultimately consumers are driven by a desire for a bigger and better product, however this desire is largely due to the advancement of advertising in which companies can draw in customers through a series of psychological tricks. Can we blame the fast fashion industry on any of this corporations for that matter? Of course we can but assigning blame still does nothing for our society. The only real change will occur when people stop buying things out of pure desire which contributes nothing to their physical and mental well being. This is yet another example of how Americans contribute to climate change through generational habits taught to us by our parents.

All industries produce to sell to make waste. Although I do not think any specific person is responsible for consumerism, I believe that it is the endless cycle of supply and demand that is the issue. Companies do not nearly care enough for their consequences and consumers buy because they are made to think they need something. Try to recall the last time you actually felt hungry to the point your stomach started growling at you. Do you eat because you are hungry or because you are bored? I think this concept can be applied to what the readings are trying to say as frequent consumers most likely can’t recall a day where they were cut off from their shopping habits. In my opinion and experience, I think that people shop for multiple reasons chiefly being that we want change in our lives whether it is to impress people or show off a sense of social status of cleanliness.
                 <br><br>
Packard in “Waste-makers” analyzes the automobile industry like the Ford and how they supply newer models of cars in the 1900’s since society as a whole has the mentality of getting rid of something once it gets out of trend. This also reminds me of the quote where Henry David Thoreau says things about the fashion industry, “The head monkey at Paris puts on a traveler's cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same”. In fact, all industries stepped into the production movement of the fashion industry with mass production. Another example of this is the tobacco industry who switched their consumer target to younger children with the comic representative Joe Camel. This was to addict children into taking ten years off their lives in exchange for their primary benefit of making profit.

I found it interesting how Packard described the consumer as consuming partially for the sake of building the economy, and feel that this consumerism is extremely relevant in todays society. Many friends, family, and politicians seem to believe that we are only a strong country because of our economy, and use this argument to put down plans for a green new deal, or the transition of energy to renewables, stating that this would cause a loss of jobs in the fossil fuel industry, failing to see the big picture and the jobs that would be produced in clean energy industry. In a similar respect, Packards points about factories beginning to simply adjusting trim is also relevant in todays society, with respect to cars, phones, laptops, electronics and appliances. Apple, microsoft, and other large tech companies actually change little in the new devices that they release roughly every two years, other than alter slight aesthetics of the devices, yet the consumer loves it and falls over themself to buy the newer version of the product.
                  <br><br>
I find it interesting how the producers finds new ways to convince consumers to buy more of their product than they actually need, and the subtle ways in wich they do so, making consumers believe that they made the decision. I found it particularly interesting how carpet companies convinced consumers that they deserved more carpet than they had, as this is how smart phone and car companies often advertise, telling consumers they deserve better.
                 <br><br>
 Being born into this culture of consumerism values, according to Ken this should be the only life that I know, and, I too, should be a super-consumer. However, this idea assumes a few things, and therefor I stray from the path of the modern consumer. I personally was brought up by parents born in the baby boomer era, with both parents having come from moderate families who did not spend much money on frivolous items. I too was brought up in this manner, and as such I do not consume as much. By this point I mean to express the idea that rather than a culture making a person, the people around a person make that person. 
                 <br><br>
 Planned obsolescence is emphasized far more today, with every electronic, automotive, clothing and consumer product being made to be b ought and discarded, to increase the profits large corporations can make from the consumer. You can not blame the consumer for their consumption any more than the addict who was injected with the drug they are addicted to while asleep the first time. Targeting a consumer and then  blaming them is simply illogical.

I'm surprised to see these same tactics being used today in our market.  Paralleling the cigarette companies, vapes have been marketing towards underage kids implicitly and creating a one-time use product. The vapes themselves have candy-like flavors and come in a colorful variety. The brand that I'm referencing is the puffball, which gained popularity in recent years among my peers. These vapes have aesthetic and addictive desirability. Its one-time use is what makes consumers waste so much, but it keeps them to buy more as the product is used. These companies learn from past success, and we see history repeating itself with this abuse of consumerism. Reading "The Waster Makers," made me realize how vulnerable w are as a population to these larger companies. They have so much influence on our lifestyle, and it's all for a better profit rather than truly helping the world become a better place. I hope that we together can realize the effects these companies have on us, and resist such conflict.

The book really elaborates on how and why consumers in the US tend to renew things that often. To summarize, the inefficiency of the behavior to the environment is mostly business-driven. If we divide the market into two parts, consumer power and manufacturing power, the US consuming behavior is the direct result of absolute manufacturing power. I don’t doubt the US’s economic prosperity after WWII, and people tend to be wealthier as well. Now, with consumer power, people can work less, have more savings, and thus live a better life. However, with manufacturing power, businessmen try to squeeze out people’s savings through persuading them to renew items more than necessary through three major ways as shown in the book, function, quality and desirability. I mean for me, I do not feel any morally uncomfortable when I hear about business’s strategies to persuade people to buy more items (except for the case the professor mentioned that tobacco corporation). Since it is really hard to regulate the business itself as it is intrinsically benefit-pursuing, it is easier and more realistic to raise people’s awareness, just like the minimalism we read about last week. In fact, we need to think about one thing when the business uses the unemployment rate as an excuse for their ad strategies. Why will more people get unemployed? Why is it not people need to work less and earn less? (Since their daily expenses shrink.) For me, that’s quite plain that the only thing we can do is to change our consciousness by not being led away by ads and salesmen. 

                  <br><br>

Yeah, after all, I don't think there is something striking and challenge me in this video, although I do understand more about how businesses actually trigger people to purchase more than they need.

After reading The Waste Makers by Vance Packard, I was shocked and astonished to see how powerful and ubiquitous the consumer culture is in the U.S. and that it exerts wide-ranging influences into our daily lives. Packard does a fantastic job of explaining and digging up the historical background of the rise of American consumerism in the 20th century, and it was a totally eye-opening experience reading the book. In regards to the trend of producing “new products” by the manufacturing companies, Packard shows that those companies are not really making innovative, new products but are rather making new or packaging ideas and concepts. Indeed, it is actually fairly difficult to continuously make and produce products that are completely new and unheard of by the public and most of the time those so-called new products are rather old, existing products with a few added features. This is just one of the several tactics used by the manufacturing companies to reap more profits from their merchandise by encouraging the customers to buy more of their products.

                  <br><br>

Another part of the reading that really shook me was the extent that those companies are willing to go in order to make the customers buy their products more. Packard gives a couple of example in the reading such as the statement “HOME MEANS MORE WITH CARPET ON THE FLOOR” (Packard, 29) by the carpet companies, the gender-specific deodorant kit for couple when they could have used the same deodorant, the color matching of tissue boxes to the specific room colors in the house as “there's a color for every room in your home” (Packard, 31), the “double ring” for married couples or that both the groom and the bride should have a golden wedding ring, and many more. In a sense, it is pretty amazing to see how creative those manufacturing companies can be when it comes to their companies’ profits that they would make any type of statements to appeal to the public and the customers so people will buy more of their stuff. The companies are so successful at doing so that those above-mentioned advertising seem beyond normal in today’s society; in fact, we as consumers become so accustomed and used to these prevalent, intense forms of advertising that we would gladly accept and follow them nowadays when we hear them instead of questioning ourselves, “Do we really need these products? Can we live a day without purchasing those products? What values can those products add to my life? If they do not add any value to my life, then we probably should not buy those products because there is no point in doing so.” If we can all ask ourselves a series of similar questions before we purchase a “new product” next time, then maybe the impacts of the American consumer culture would be gradually reduced. 

                  <br><br>

This week’s reading again reminds me of last week’s reading, which was Thoreau’s Walden, and last week’s topic of minimalism. The minimalist lifestyle makes even more sense to me now that I read The Waste Makers and understand the root causes and influences of the rampant consumerism because people continue to buy newer and newer products, and frequently the reason for their purchase is due to obsolescence of desirability, or that people feel they need to buy newer products not because the old product is no longer functioning but rather that it is out of “style”. This is sad and even a bit pathetic if we think about it: the “style” of a product seems to outweigh all of its other more practical features because people are going for the “look”, the “fad”, and the “trend” that they no longer pay attention to more practical aspects of the product such as whether it functions well.

While reading "The Waste Markers," I couldn't stop thinking about how all of us are just puppets to the major industries. It surprises me that they are able to manipulate society into buying their products and all though the government does set up rules for them, most of the time they find ways to still false advertise to the public. You would think that things like this would get punished here in America but instead they are getting richer while we the consumers get poorer. This goes back to the idea of minimalism and how we have been given this false idea that our successfulness depends on the amount of stuff we own and their value. Consumerism has evolved the past few years just like the idea of the American Dream has. Many others and myself have the misconception that things we buy will overall make our lives happier. While taking this course, I have came up with the conclusion that we have been brainwashed by industries to buy and buy. We need to reconsider our own values and not try to be things we are not. We need to be different and not followers, just because others may seem like happy with what they have,  doesn't mean we will be happy in the same way. everyone is different in their own ways. This overall consumption of products has unfortunately taken a major toll with the current climate crisis.

Reading Chapters 2-7 of Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” wasn’t particularly shocking but I still found it to be informative. As Ken stated in this video, as someone who was born in the 21st century, this rampant culture of fast-paced consumerism seems almost normal to me so it was interesting to read an older perspective from the 1960s on the social and cultural change as it was happening. 
                  <br><br>


I think that both the corporations and us, the consumers, are partially to blame but I think the culpability is not at all evenly split. It’s easy for corporations to say that consumers are the problem and we do propagate this seemingly endless and accelerating cycle, but if there’s one thing that has made clear it’s that consumers are the victims of the deception and marketing ploys of corporations who are willing to do anything to sell more products and make more money.   
                   <br><br>

Before this class, I read that this new economy of rapid consumerism has actually made it so that the quality of products has been reduced, oftentimes intentionally by companies. The rationale was that when the product breaks after a short term period, the consumer feels like they have to go out and buy a new and “better” model to replace the old and broken one. 

                  <br><br>

A similar phenomenon is at the heart of the electronic industry. The year after you buy a smartphone, it is already said to be obsolete by companies like Apple or Samsung. In essence, the lifecycle of smartphones is ridiculously short and the way they set up their apps and operating systems make it so that all the “cool new updates” (which are actually minimal changes that are blown out of proportion) only work on the newer phone models at which point the consumer has two options: Keep what you have for a little longer before eventually succumbing to peer pressure when you start to feel behind the times or immediately go out and buy the new phone. Either way, the corporations have set up a situation that is win-win for them and financially a lose-lose for the consumers. 

                  <br><br>

The smartphone and electronics industry in particular sticks out to me as one of the worst evils of our rapid consumerist culture because those old phones that are so quickly discarded are almost never recycled. 

                  <br><br>

In conclusion, I think advertisements and marketing are actually one of the main problems and culprits that cause the fast-paced consumerism we see in our societies. Not only are advertisements constantly geared towards making new consumers out of younger generations (and older generations) but marketing ploys are also one of the main reasons consumers are tricked into discarding their so-called “old” products and buying new ones.

I agree with you on every point. When you said that "the quality of products has been reduced, oftentimes intentionally by companies," I remember how engineers mentioned in the book were put in a dilemma because they were forced to make poorer products so that people would wear them out sooner. Companies now gear towards quantity instead of quality. Even though there is nothing wrong with the quality of a product, this "planned obsolescence" might be integrated into a company's strategy. For this point, Apple is a great example like you said. What I imagine is that they have strategically planned out which upgrade on which aspect of which device for their half-yearly new product conference for the next five years at least. Even though there is only a slight change, people still buy into it. It's astonishing how this is still true and prevalent after nearly 80 years. 

                  <br><br>


Peer pressure not only exists among people but among those giant corporations as well. As one company like Apple roll our their new products, other companies, in order to compete for customers, have to do the same to be in the market. This is not just saying that another mobile device company like Huawei and Samsung adds more products to announce each year, but companies like Google who don't originally produce phones now also enter the market. But the question is -- do we really need that many companies to just produce some phones with the difference mostly in their colors and how they look?


<br><hr>
I like what you said about consumerism regarding the electronic industry. Reading The Waste Makers truly made me realize how each of the three obsolescences Packard mentions relates to electronics, like smartphones. A few years after buying any given iPhone, one can expect that the one you bought will be almost useless, because of iOS updates that only apply to the newer models released; this is an example of obsolescence of function. iPhones are believed to also have a set lifetime on them, so it is only a matter of 5 years or so before they no longer work; this is an example of obsolescence of quality. People always want the newest iPhone, so they often trash the previous one they had to have the most recent, advanced version; this is an example of obsolescence of desirability. The 3 kinds of obsolescence can be applied to iPhones, cars, and clothes today. The fact that these principles defined in the 1960s are still prevalent now tell me that it's time for a "new normal" to be put into place, because so many products that we own for a short time is terrible for the environment.
                  <br><br>

Regarding whose fault rampant consumerism is, I think corporations and consumers both play a role; however, corporations make a bigger impact on this issue. With advertisements essentially anywhere we look, it is hard to blame just the people buying products on why overconsumption is a reality. Companies feed us several products in short periods of time that make consumers feel like they need to "keep up"; this results in a high turnover rate of clothing and smartphones, and higher profits for the companies selling. Companies should focus on offering longer-lasting products less frequently while consumers shouldn't be so quick to trash items that are fully functional in order to collaboratively get the fashion, auto, and electronic industries to reach a more environmentally friendly standard.

Reading these chapters left me feeling overwhelmed by the number of goods I have seemingly been coerced into buying as a result of good marketing. As someone who likes to think of themselves are pretty mindful of what I purchase, I still easily fall into the trap of convenience goods, especially with food. In college, microwave or instant meals are widely popular because of how easy it is to make and the lack of dishes as a result. Realizing that this is actually costing me more than cooking rice and beans from scratch was an eye-opener. However, I think pushing people away from a convenient lifestyle is extremely hard. As Ken had asked in the video, both the consumers and corporations are responsible for the wasteful, consumptive habits we now have. It is largely the fault of corporations for pushing these new goods onto us using psychological research and shady methods of marketing. They are the ones that pushed the consumer to buy. However, now as the consumer, we need to reevaluate our desires and consumption habits in order to break away from all the waste. This is where issues lie because people do not want to give up convenience because of how hard they worked to get it. And that makes sense, but it looks like it’s hiking up a higher cost than we worked so hard for.

In a capitalist society, who are consumers to tell corporations how hard to push products? If there was no marketing, there would be very little competition. Yes, corporations are responsible for the wasteful, consumptive habits we now have, but the root cause is capitalism. I agree that In college, it is so much easier to buy convenience goods, and it makes sense because we are all sleep deprived and never have enough time for anything. I am at fault for not  caring about the consumer foods that I buy, but at what cost is taking more time out of your day to prepare a cheaper meal that is good for the planet? That would take away from my study and sleep time. Fast, convenient meals are horrible for the environment, produce a ton of trash, have to get shipped all over the world, and most importantly are not at all healthy for you. The "Wayback Machine" brings up the point that our consumer (waste) culture is fueled by corporations trying to make different forms of the same products. At the end of the day, the problem is that our economy is based on unlimited growth, which is completely unsustainable.

The Waste Makers by Vance Packard actually relates quite well to The Story of Stuff by Annie Leonard, another book I've been reading lately. Both have mentioned the concept of planned obsolescence: obsolescence of function, quality and desirability. One example that highlights this concept would be the annual rush for the newest iPhone; although it's a smart marketing ploy by Apple to constantly reintroduce the newest, coolest model of their product, it does huge damage to the environment as people frantically wait in line to swap their devices for the next version, even though the ones they have in hand were probably the newest, coolest thing just a few months ago. Given that consecutive generations of smartphones do not vary much in functionality and quality, this obsolescence of desirability is truly the worst kind of consumerism that exists.
                  <br><br>

If Packard had come to observe the global frenzy today, 60 years after he wrote The Waste Makers, he'd be shocked by how much worse the problem has become. I'm not a huge fan of chasing after the newest iPhone myself, but I can't help but feel pessimistic about how we can change this culture. This is the way we live now, and if Apple doesn't lead the competition via endless supply & demand, another brand will. I can only do so much to maintain a minimalist lifestyle myself and perhaps persuade a few others, but it feels like pouring a cup of water on top of a raging forest fire...

I appreciate the Apple example you gave, and your overall comment definitely sums up my attitude towards today's consumerism as well. Your example is very apt in describing the mass consumerism mess and tasteless social values we have right now. I personally never understood the need to keep up with the newest Iphone trend either. If my current model is functional to satisfy all my needs, why do I need to "upgrade" to a newer model, knowing that Apple is just pulling some cheap tricks to better its sales when in fact the newer model is not much different from its previous model. I, too, understand your frustration regarding the matter of there is only so much we can do. Falling back to the Apple example, I always get asked by my friends to help them decide what colour of the new model  Iphone they should get, and when I ask them if the one they have now is broken, I almost always get the response along the lines of "no, I just want the new one". In cases like this, it's obvious that they are not impulse buying because they are going around asking friends to help them decide, but I truly wonder if they understand the consequences behind keeping up with the trend or buy things just because they want it. In this perspective, I think a lot of people with purchasing power are still massively undereducated. If people could just dedicate as much time as asking their friends what colour Iphone they should get into researching the detrimental effects producing iphones, the environment and our social values could be in a much better position right now.

While reading Vance Packard’s classic 1960 study of consumerism: The Waste Makers, it gave me an insight into how the producers view the consumers. It’s almost like the consumers are at the bottom of the food chain and the producers are controlling everything that we buy and how much or fast we buy it. It’s almost scary how much this 1960 study applies today, as if he predicted the future of America. The fact that producers only care about money and not the well being of people is frightening. Especially in the video how Ken used the example of cigarettes, it makes me scared with the new market of vaping. The fact that producers are now marketing to children from a young age is even more frightening and just goes to show the companies interests. With now trash and piles of clothes filling up the landfills, it's tough to see how wasteful people are, even when they were warned so many years ago. I'm glad that I was brought up in a home where I learned to take care of the environment through recycling, not littering, and even composting. I was also taught to use all of my things as to not take anything for granted.

Chapter 4 of The Waste Makers had a profound impact on me. As I read through, I kept thinking about what things around me and what I use today are just apart of this consumerism trick. Am I just being persuaded to use and buy things without even knowing it? I was just thinking about apple products. It is so clear that they want us to consume their products more. I mean, they have to keep us on a cycle so that they can stay in profit. They come out with new phones with less buttons, but a better camera and other "cool" (but useless) features. Remember when they took away that earphone jack? Now you either spend $200 for airpods or you get a "dongle" that connects to your earphones but you can't charge up and listen to music at the same time. And just like the cigarettes that Ken mentioned, Apple knows these dongles are crappy! They are only $9 and only last you a few months (because they are crappy). But people still upgrade and buy airpods because they have made it look cool. Even I think people with airpods are somehow better off than I am??? So now I am wondering how the heck did they persuade me so easily and quickly. It's something they have been doing for a long time and I wonder if we all were to realize this and stop buying as much, will the economy plummet? Will we have to pay or suffer to reset the consumerism culture and become environmentally cautious?

It is crazy how companies push out new and updated products once or twice a year with very minimal changes and we still buy it. The companies market many items as industry changing ideas that will revolutionize your life, but many of these products do not really add much more value to your life than the last years version. For example, apple pushes out new phones twice a year, but they make very small changes. The last big jump was from having a homebutton to face ID. This was almost 2 years ago, yet they have come out with multiple new phones that don’t really have greatly improved features except a slightly better camera. This constant pushing of new products is not sustainable and is very wasteful. Industry needs to change their culture and business models to preserve more of our planet’s resources.

After this week’s reading, I was disappointed at how our country has become so materialistic over the years. The quote “The average citizen in the United States is consuming twice as much in the way of goods as the average citizen consumed in the years just before World War II” is just one quote that exemplifies what this country has become to. I am not saying that I am not a part of this problem by any means, because I am this way as well. This country is run on money, and if we consumers do not continue to purchase at an alarming rate, the economy will suffer because of it. Due to this, companies have made it a mission to persuade as many people as they can to keep buying their products. This is a reason why clothing companies style and promote their clothes for 52 seasons. This, in a way, makes it the companies fault, as “in some cases, the consumers have no choice but to be waste makers because of the way products are sold to them.” I believe that our generation has to have a change of mindset and living in order for this planet to be habitable for years to come. Wouldn’t you want your kids to have a planet to happily be on?

I also found the fact about how much the modern person consumes compared to a person 80 years ago extremely unsettling. Everyone has so much STUFF that is completely unnecessary, and in the end, will just end up in a landfill to sit there for 5 years. I am guilty of having too much stuff. I'm sure almost everyone in this class is guilty of that. But why is that? Is it because we were raised on consumerism? or is it because humans have the innate desire to accumulate things? Whatever the cause is, my fears lie in the fact that Americans aren't just going to ditch half their items for the environment, and if they did, who's to say they won't reaccumulate their items in the next 5 years? regardless of the reasons why we want so many things, our generation needs to go back to how we were 80 years ago and stop buying things that give us immediate satisfaction, but delayed regrets.

According to the book "The Waste Makers," consumerism first started in America due to the increase of productivity. After the Industrial Revolution, the number of goods were gradually grew beyond the consumer's needs. Thus, in order to continue making profits, producers began to spread the concept of consumerism, which encourages people to buy more products and throw old products regularly. As a result, each family owned a car, a TV, and other staff, though some of these goods are not really required. However, this level of purchasing were still far less than the producing rate. Hence, producers tried to put some decorations on their products, which didn't change the function but only the outlook of the good. In this way, they successfully persuading the consumers to buy the same product twice. Today, the Strategies of advertising are even more clever. For example, by connecting a good with a sense of fashion or the life of upper class, producers brainwash to consumers that if they buy the product, they are at front of fashion. It creates an illusion that if I buy a good, I will own a better life and it wins me face. However, it is absolutely not true. Purchasing a well-looking luxury bag doesn't means you live a life of upper class, it will only makes you poorer. Victor Lebow
                   <br><br>
notes a term called "forced consumption." He mentions that our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfactions, our ego satisfactions, in consumption. The lie of consumerism leads to unreasonable purchase and overload producing, which is the primary cause of climate change. People need to aware of this and think twice before buying goods.

Planned obsolescence is an appalling form of manipulation. It’s a strategy to influence the product or the relationship of the product to the consumer. Even though the “old” item is in good condition functional, companies introduce the idea that the newer version of the same item functions better. These companies pressure consumers to buy newer goods because they know people’s identities, for some reason, are defined by what they have. Companies groom people to enter a cycle of buy, use, throwaway, and buy again because that’s how they company prospers.  The materials that are thrown away, plastic, for example, which is any synthetic material (nylon, PVC, polystyrene, polycarbonate, etc.) take hundreds of years to degrade and emit harmful chemicals to the environment. However, while the economy may be doing well, the planet is suffering. A booming economy won’t matter when there is no planet to support such a thing.

The companies are not the only ones to blame. Companies are the sellers, but consumers are the buyers. Some Americans, as evidenced by this article, recognize that they’ve been conditioned to respond to obsolescence, so changing their relationship to new items is their responsibility in order to minimize the impact of obsolescence. Americans should recondition their minds to not find their worth in worldly things. Instead of seeking fulfillment in goods, people should be seeking fulfillment in friendships, family, relationships, etc. Not only would the planet benefit from it through less waste, people would also create community – essential in attacking the climate crisis.

The Waste Makers was a very insightful reading because it truly made me reevaluate hard about all the qualities present in the things that I buy. Indeed, from phones to clothes to makeup and more everything that is marketed to us most likely has been done with planned obsolescence in foresight by the manufacturer, which I had never stopped to ponder before. Examples of this include Apple which has come under fire in the past for making the batteries of their old phones degrade when it's time to debut a new phone model or the fashion industry as a whole which changes what is considered trendy and fashionable pretty much every few days on pure whim. Reading about how women's clothes such as dresses typically have a 7-10 year window of usage in which the article of clothing is actually worn before being deemed old or unfashionable is actually very true because I have several clothes that I pick up totally enamored with but a few years down the line I honestly can't bear to look at it any longer. Perhaps its true that humans get bored very easily and need constant change in their lives which they fuel by constantly buying the next new thing but obviously we have to pin some responsibility upon the advertising agencies who capitalize upon that boredom to make sure they get a profit out of introducing things to us that we don't need. We as consumers also need to start learning that items will not become obsolete just because a trend deems it to be so and take agency in determining those things for ourselves.

I knew that American consumerism was becoming more and more dangerous as each day passed, but I honestly didn't know that it was still bad, until I read "The Waste Makers." This book really brought insight on not just the detrimental effects of consumerism, but also the cause-and-effect chain of how it began.
                   <br><br>
Chapter 2 started off with a pretty shocking fact: the average citizen is consuming twice as much goods as the average citizen consumed just before World War 2. In addition, nearly two-fifths of the items people own are not essential, but rather just optional or luxurious items. It's really sad that especially in America, so many items and products are being made and consumed by society when they are not absolutely necessary; even foreigners pointed out that the abundance of America "seems to spill over into the aisle of stores." 
                   <br><br>
The chapters explained that this recent increase of greater consumption was inspired by the bulging inventories of goods in America, which was caused by the efficiency of the US productive force and the great expansion of US productive facilities. An example of this is the concept of the two-house family, which was introduced by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. To continue selling their home products, this agency would encourage Americans to have 2 refrigerators, 2 washers, 2 dryers, and so on. Many Americans became hungry for this consumption within their homes and were incentivized to have more bathrooms, rooms, furnitures, and kitchens than necessary.
                   <br><br>
Ultimately, it's really shocking that before our generation, frugality was the main rule of thumb, with the common phrase being "waste not, want not." Instead of dumping items that they did not need anymore, pioneers in the US would auction it off, so that at least the items can be purchased secondhand. This concept would be called high marginal utility, as each used and fabricated items was still considered cherished. Although I am heavily discouraged by the status quo and the excessive consumption, I hope that we will return to the past and take action for our planet.

These chapters were truly crazy to read and unlike anything I have read for this class since the book was written in 1960. The principles that companies today use to maximize profit were in place in 1960 and they are terribly unethical and inhumane. One strategy used is that there is always room for more. For example, women should have one swimsuit for the morning sun, one swimsuit for the noonday sun, and one swimsuit for the evening sun. Another strategy used is progress through the throwaway spirit. In many cases, the consumers have no choice but to be wasteful because of how the products are sold to them. Examples of this are purposefully easy-to-break kid’s toys and throw-away baking tins and plastic bags. Often, packaging costs many times more than the item itself for the company. In my opinion, the two most gross and unethical strategies used are planned obsolescence in quality and planned obsolescence in desirability. Obsolescence in quality refers to how long a product will last. Companies literally change the design life of a lamp from 300 hours to 200 hours and automotive designers practice death control on their cars. This is disgusting. Obsolescence in desirability translates to convincing the public that style is important. Practices include “color forecasting”, changing the degree of ornamentation, and changing profile (Ex: moving the hemline up or down). These changes do not matter; they just make more money and this is the only thing American corporations care about.

Reading "The Waste Maker" felt like reading a psychological analysis of the old me. In my earlier years, fashion and having "steez" was very valuable to me. I saw my clothes as an extension of myself because it was almost like a physical display of what I thought was cool. For first impressions, I truly believed that style had a large part. I still love clothes but have realized that the newest thing doesn't always mean better.  It should come as no shock that California has good weather, it's never too cold or hot. With that being said, I still bought new clothes for each season to "protect" me against the cold air or hot breeze. 
                   <br><br>

  New trends are constantly revealing itself, and being in a technology era, it almost felt like a race to keep up. And this mentality is exactly what large companies want.
                   <br><br>

  Style plays so heavily in our culture and at this point being different is not different anymore, "the new normal becomes just normal." Companies, more than anyone, understands their audience and fosters products for exactly them. Vance Packard really sheds light on the lengths companies will go to for money. It was crazy to read how companies attempted to even put a "product death date" on certain items. It was crazy that companies were purposely making items for obsolescence. The marketing for womenswear became applicable to anything they could sell and people were buying into it. These companies were setting the trends and everyone else followed. In some cases, they could even predict what color would be in season. This article gave me a better understanding of how fossil-fuel companies work. While both are bad for the environment in their own way, they continue to have any presence because of money. Companies are sacrificing the future so that they could make a check.

I wanted to respond to your comment on the reading “The Waste Makers” because I also struggle with the consumption of fashion. When I was younger having the coolest clothes was so important to me. This is embarrassing to admit but I would often become frustrated or even upset when I “couldn’t find anything to wear”. Its not that I didn’t have anything to wear but that anything I had was out of style compared to the new trends that just came out. I shared the same understanding that what you wear means something and that the best way to make a great first impression was to look and be dressed nice. I also grew up in southern California but like clockwork would need to new summer clothes and new swimsuits every year because wearing last years wasn’t even an option. I grew up in a home where this was normal. My mom and I always bonded over the love of shopping. When I was having a bad week she would take me to Marshall's and we would spend a long time going through the store getting things we obviously didn’t need because we had something similar already.
                   <br><br>

After reading Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” I was shocked to see how manipulating big industries have gone to make consumption the norm. Our economy depends on people buying and throwing away. I agree with you that largely companies are to blame for our never-ending consumption. Like Packard wrote” in some cases consumers have no choice but to be waste makers because of the way products are sold to them” (48). However, I think once you have become aware of these issues you have to take some accountability. Knowing what I know now about fast fashion I have been avoiding the urge to impulsively buy, unless absolutely necessary. Sense I am lucky enough to live in-group housing I am able to borrow clothes from friends and roommates, significantly reducing the need to go and buy something for a special event. 
                    <br><br>


I personally think the large corporations are to blame for our consumer behavior. They do so by implementing obsolescence of function, quality, and desirability. Fast fashion is usually cheap. In both quality and cost. I have bought clothes before that shrunk after just one wash forcing me to go and buy it again. Advertisement makes sure that we feel like we need the new and best version of something we already have. Or what Packard describes as obsolescence of desirability. I think many of the products bought today fall within one or more of these three categories. Even if someone does not believe in climate change there is no denying that the items we throw away end up in landfills and our oceans. This is turning our world into a waste dump. I think it’s completely unethical for companies to be purposefully creating items that are to be thrown away because of obsolescence of function or quality.


<br><hr>
I agree with you that clothing is very much of a physical display of ourselves, but whichever clothes we wear do not ever represent one’s personality or manner. I think that the number of goods you own does not define how a person is. Notably, the latest fashion design or most expensive brand isn’t indifferent to any other clothing brand. They are the lure to our eyes. I tend to consume a lot of new clothes to be cool, but as I read the book and Ken’s other material, I figure out how materialism mind stuck in our head. Trend and a so-called “fashion” never cease to change, which allows people to consumer endlessly while the company attracts our attention. This article enables me to understand how we should keep our belongings longer and how we should not consume unnecessary stuff. We should reflect on our consuming culture into a saving culture. Sometimes, an extra function or appearance will not make the overall experience much different. Therefore, according to the article, we should not practice obsolescence but more on savings.

In 1960, both party platforms called for more growth and differed only on how it should be achieved. If those in control are preaching this then those most vulnerable are going to be the most swayed and think that is how life and consumerism is supposed to be. We are all victims of consumerism. In America, it is just assumed that growth is good. For example, we have been taught that globalization of the world is good. That westernizing third world countries will only help them. In reality, globalization is only draining the world’s resources, destroying cultures and societies, and widening the gap between not only rich and poor but also between the roles of men and women. Farmers and big ag are modifying plants to survive the constant addition of fertilizer so that the soil does not have to rest and the US can sustain its economy.  “A good deal of what is called product research today actually is on sales promotion…” and “...publicized money going to research of new drugs was actually being spent in a quest for petentable variations on things that were already selling well” (14). I have such a problem with this. These are medicines people need to survive and companies are making a profit by making variations. 

                    <br><br>

Families in the US are using the family budget for optional luxury items. What the worst part about in order to sustain the economy, the US needs to start consuming more because products and labor is so cheap these days. As a result, companies are pushing for more disposables to be bought. 

                    <br><br>

A dilemma arose in the mid-twentieth century’s era of abundance. There was a shift from Say’s Law to developing a public that would “always have an appetite as voracious as its machines” (23). Thus, a new market was created in the 60s, a market of wastefulness. What I never thought about was the fact that companies introduce colors into their products to make it more “individualized”; their real intentions is to make more money. From stockings, to nail polish, swimsuits, and even kleenex. 
                    <br><br>


Another tactic used by companies was forced consumption. Take the lawn-mower example. The lawn-mower industry played on male masculinity and was able to convince American males that it was somehow shameful to be seen pushing a hand mower. As a result, power-mower sales rose exponentially. This tactic is not limited to lawn-mowers but also mufflers, bigger cars using more gas at once, and pimping out cars (air conditioning, automatic transmissions, etc.). The entire goal is wanting people to be attracted to the new and not the old so consumerism will continue to grow. The transition for scarcity to an increase in consumerism only encouraged disposables. In the US, people destroy and waste products at a rate that “offered considerable encouragement to those charged with achieving ever higher levels of consumption for their products” (42). When The Waste Makers mentioned that the U.S. would tear down a perfectly good skyscraper only to be replaced by another one. This kills me.
                    <br><br>


The obsolescence creation as a strategy to persuade the public that style is an important element in desirability of one’s product seems like an evil tactic. It is an illusion. "Most design changes are made not for improving the product, either esthetically or functionally, but for making it obsolete." (69). These companies believe this is socially justifiable because it redistributes wealth… like wtf is that all about. It just seems…. Evil.  The obsolescence creation as a strategy only perpetuates wastefulness. 
                    <br><br>


Disposable also played on the time crunch of families. For example, steak in aluminum frying pans. JUST THROW OUT THE ENTIRE THING THAT WAY GREASE CLEAN UP IS EASY, they say. Of course this is going to appeal to the moms and dads who are busy working and the kids are busy with school and extracurricular activities. And the kicker is, the packaging costs “ten times as much as the product inside” (45). Personally, I had no idea but I am also not surprised.

<p>
After reading the Waste Makers chapters 2-7, the main thing I could think was if only Mr Packard could see the world as it is today, or what if this book was written today? How much worse would the accusations and allegations be?! Much much worse. It is also absolutely mind-blowing how dependent the US economy is on consumerism and consumer expenditure. The economy will deteriorate if the average consumer doesn’t increase their consumption by 50%. The US lost 100 billion dollars worth of potential output because of under utilization of its productive capacity. Before this I never fully understood why politicians were telling us to “spend, spend, spend” in times of recession, but now I understand it completely, the entire economy is dependent on our expenditure and contribution to the economy. 
                    <br><br>

Despite this, I never fully comprehended the level of waste that we produce. Packard stated how they found that “In most households we found there were two to five rolls of scotch tape- but no one could locate any of them.” I related to that fact in a major major way, because I could see myself as one of those individuals that buys a big pack of scotch tape or glue sticks or pens so that they’ll last me a long time, but then I’ll misplace them and be too lazy to go find them, so I end up buying more, and now I have two packs of things that I really don't need. 
                    <br><br>

Another thing I found extremely interesting was the power of advertising and in a sense ‘brainwashing’ that the advertising companies in the US utilize for their own benefit. They think about everything, from the color to the shape to the placement of the goods on the shelf, everything they do in some way makes the product more desirable to us. For instance, by changing the color of the potato peeler to yellow, the customer is more likely to throw away the potato peeler with the rest of the potato skin, because it will get lost amongst the waste. Therefore, the customer will have to go and buy a new potato peeler. However, the color yellow is not as appealing to the customer so they put a colorful paper in the packaging so that they would attract the customer. However genius that may be, it still blows my mind how much the companies think about how to psychologically trick the customer to buy the products, and buy them again and again. 
                    <br><br>

All of this and I still have not brought up the maleficent notion of planned obsolescence, where engineers of products purposely create the product to break down after a certain time, so that they can encourage repeat purchases. A modern example of this could be Apple. When Apple releases the iphone 7 for example, it already has the designs for the 8, 9 and possibly even the 10 in development, so that they can induce repeated purchases.

<p>
I don’t think to buy a lot of stuff is a mistake before I watch this book and take this class. In other words, I can’t imagine fashion was related to the climate crisis. I just think if I have the ability to have more, just get more staff. When economic growth, the company has more income, so they produce more staff. We also have the ability to buy more stuff. This is kind of a loop. 
                    <br><br>
But after taking this class, I think about the things I purchased before. A lot of goods are unnecessary for me. There also have some goods that I even didn’t open, although I have bought them for months. We are shopping impulsive and don’t have time to think about whether this good is necessary, or not. At 00:00 on November 11, the Tmall Global Carnival (similar to Black Friday) opened, and the turnover exceeded RMB 10 billion in only 96 seconds, 29 seconds less than in 2018. By 0:12:49, Tmall's turnover exceeded 50 billion yuan. Impulsive consumption seems hard to change when the company has a great discount on their goods. There is an idea now that “There is always room for more products in the home.” People live in a bigger house than before, so they have more space to put goods. If they buy the good that don’t like, they can just throw it away or give to somebody else. People don’t hard to feel pity because this good is cheap, and it is unnecessary to them.
                    <br><br>
I hope everyone can consume rationally in order to save our planet.

After reading this week’s, “The Waste Makers”. I found out that Americans are consuming more and disregarding stuff at an increasing rate over the past decade. Our society has been dominated by consumer industries in terms of fashion and automobile, thus the idea of planned obsolescence. Personally, I am guilty for being part of the fashion industry. I tend to buy clothes as my collection and usually replace them every year. I find it embarrassing to admit that I am getting clothes from companies that are either abusing their work labor or harming the environment, or both. I had never imagined that me participating by buying clothes off the fashion industry would contribute to climate change. It seems like people who love fashion are being driven by the art and amount of compliments we get when we buy new clothes, just to look “fresh”.Furthermore, the readings tackle how we as a consumer tend to upgrade stuff like our phones and cars just because it is not trending anymore, without knowing the consequence of advancing, I realized that we are slowly hurting the environment. This week’s reading is truly an eye-opener in reflecting how I buy things around me, it seems like most of us Americans are taking our demand and supply for granted, our consumer needs is being driven by our expectations, expectations that could never be fulfilled.

I agree with your comment, and its honestly also evident with products like the iPhone. They sell us their product with minor improvements and that is honestly enough for us consumers to buy them. Even if we just got a new version 6-12 months ago, it is a necessity for us to upgrade our version just to fit in with the trend. I’ve also been guilty with doing this in the past and never really learned of the effects until now. I honestly don’t understand the necessity in upgrading in the past, since what I owned worked perfectly fine. This reading honestly opened my eyes to the way companies have used their tactics on me to purchase their products. I found it interesting seeing the techniques they use to do this. This honestly kind of made me want to try out a minimalistic type of life in the future. It’ll be a way for me to value what I have, and realize that purchasing for the sake of fitting a trend is detrimental to our futures on the planet. The one thing that worries me though is the obsession many people have who can’t resist doing things like upgrading their phones, or getting that newest piece of clothing.

This section of the book, The Waste Makers by Vance Packard, really made me take a step back and truly see American consumerism for what it is. Being born at the time I was, I am guilty of growing up with the new normalized society and not necessarily noticing the odd way we consume our items. Buying a new jacket does not mean my old one is unusable, which is odd to the generations that precede me. I find it completely shocking that the average United States citizen is consuming twice as much in the form of goods as the average citizen consumed in the years before world war two. What do we need so badly that the other generation was able to successfully live without? The political backing that added to the idea of the need to buy more things becoming normal in society was another huge component to the change. Politics is a game when it comes to the way the public is addressed and informed. President Eisenhower telling Americans to “buy now- the job you save may be your own”, is a key representation of the political influence that shaped society to this consumer change. The economic point of view that Eisenhower had definitely shifted his attention away from anything regarding the long term effects of his push for a larger consumer culture. This is another contributing factor to the way that the preceding generation has really made our generation’s mission to conquer the climate change problem so much harder. The name waste makers unfortunately fits perfectly with our consumer problem. Tying the back into the minimalist concept, if more people were exposed to this it could possibly successfully change our consumer culture. I know that after both the minimalism documentary as well as reading this and being exposed to the true consumer culture I will enact a change in my own life. If knowledge is the extra push that I needed, maybe others just need this too. However, some people even in my generation, which is meant to be the ones to inflict change, are aware of their carbon footprint and claim that they can not change anything anyways. I feel like buying less things and adding value to what you have is an easy change and has many more benefits than negative effects. For one, the extra money that one would not spend online shopping or strolling in a mall could be saved up for something of more than just material value.

Adding onto the point of the old jacket, it is so true about the reality of a lot of old goods many of us still have in our houses today; We just throw them away so easily even though they are entirely usable. This leads to so much waste of things, such as pants, jackets, and shirts that are still good and could be used. It is rather unfortunate that our current consumer culture is all about that, which fuels our ever growing pollution and over-stressing the resources of our Earth. As the reading said, they design our clothing now to be so quickly out of date and obsolete in so few time. There used to be two seasons, cold and hot, but now there is 52 seasons a year with new products and designs coming out every week. This directly leads to the idea of consumers throwing their clothes away, even though they are perfectly ok to use and still serve some function for us. We continue to live in this consumer culture and bring new generations in, so these ideas of consuming so much and replacing old items so quickly is becoming normalized. It is rather unfortunate, but it is the reality of things. I also like how you pointed out how politics has an effect on the consumer culture and the mass consumption of things. As you said, Eisenhower encouraged the entirety of Americans to spend in big numbers, believing it was the best for the economy, and as a sorts bailing out the industries for producing so much. The capitalistic system of America definitely favors mass industrialization, so it is no surprise that for years the government has supported this consumer culture as well.

Just like what the reading and Ken said, the economic system of the United States depends on the willingness of consumers. Before I read this book, I cannot imagine how ridiculous this system is and how absurd this system is influencing people’s life. 
                    <br><br>
In the reading “The Waste Maker,” it mentions that the produced in the United States use many different ways to sell their products because the quantity of supply is much larger than the demand. However, the way they use to sell their products is immoral. They used a kind of way named “planned obsolescence,” which is a tricky thing. However, I can understand why they will do this. The only goal for suppliers is to make as much money as they can and earn more profit for themselves. If a product can be used for a long time, the new products cannot be sold quickly. This idea suddenly reminds me of the difference in consuming a product between my parents and myself. When they decide to buy a thing, they will first consider whether they already have this kind of thing and the item they owned can still be used or not. However, when I decide to buy an item, I won’t often consider whether I already have a similar item or not. I am a people who are definitely influenced by consumerism, which means that I will follow fashion as soon as possible. Also, a suitcase bought by my parents nearly ten years ago still can be used; however, the suitcase I bought it two years ago is already broken. Although they belong to the same brand, the quality of these two suitcases has already been changed, which forces me to buy a new one. 
                    <br><br>
These two examples can show how “planned obsolescence” influenced our life. By using this, it can indeed promote the economy facially; however, has people considered the serious consequence brought by this idea? No! This is not only a kind of a waste but also a kind of overuse of natural resources. From my perspective, I think the solution to this problem is to reduce the number of fashion seasons in one year. Owning 52 fashion seasons is definitely an unnecessary and ridiculous thing. To be honest, having four fashion seasons, just like the season-spring, summer, autumn, and winter, is enough. By changing this, basically, fewer people will keep on chasing the fashionable trend, and the problem can be solved.

While reading the Waste Makers I couldn't help but feel incredibly frustrated throughout. All this time we have been learning about how our way have led to the fall of our planet and how we must change our consumer culture. However, I did not realize that there was an underlying tactic businesses use to get us to keep purchasing more items. The fact that these companies would stoop so low as to purposely diminish the lifetime of a lightbulb just so we can replace them more often so they can earn more money is infuriating. It is not only causing us to lose our hard earned money, but also feeding these corporations more money, so that they can employ their tactics on a broader scale and continue harming our environment. I do agree that we as Americans must change our consumer culture as we are simply to obsessed with owning new things, but if we as consumers change, so does the big corporations who sell these items. Its crazy that even in our obsessed culture of buying, that these corporations still have to add further tactics on top of it to consume more. Isn't what we do on our own enough? I think this book really goes to show that in order for America to change its ways its not only reliant upon us, the consumers, but rather EVERYBODY in America must do their part whether you are a consumer, producer, government, etc. No one party is to blame, but all parties share part of the blame in bringing the world to where we are. WE collectively have ruined the planet. Therefore, WE collectively have to change our ways if we are to save this planet from becoming truly uninhabitable.

After reading Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers,” I was shocked to find out how Americans, who once valued and treasured their limited possessions, shifted into this culture of mass consumerism. It’s alarming to realize just how much we consume on a daily basis and will continue to consume over the course of our lifetime. In the past, clothes were worn until the point they fell apart and could no longer be used. Nowadays, we go through clothes at a much quicker rate and replace them long before they are no longer wearable. We are quick to get rid of items that are still usable because they are no longer popular or desirable to us. Worse, we buy something only to wear it once and never see it again, tucked away in the back of our closets. It appears that the majority of our society can not be satisfied with what they have. The desire for new products and items is what drives us to spend unnecessarily and contribute to the issue of rampant consumerism. This culture of consumerism and fast fashion has ruined our planet and will continue to do so as long as people continue to purchase items at the rate we do today.

                    <br><br>

Another thing that I was surprised to discover was how companies are deliberately creating products that will break down and wear out in a few years. This act of purposely sabotaging the quality of products and shortening their lifetimes is despicable to me. Companies like these are only interested in getting people to spend more and profiting off their customers by making them buy the item multiple times. They show a blatant disregard for the environment through their actions. By knowingly creating products that will no longer be usable in a year or two, they are contributing to the increasing amount of waste that end up in our landfills each year. Instead of spending a bit more money on producing quality items that will last longer, some companies will mass produce cheap quality items that are bound to be useless soon, thus fueling the continuous cycle of consumerism.

After reading chapters two to seven of Vance Packard’s, “The Waste Makers,” I was also shocked to realize how Americans shifted into this lifestyle of mass consumerism and wastefulness. It’s true that  in the past, we held more value to our possessions but now we see them as easily discardable. In today’s age, everyone wants the newest thing. That’s why so many people jump to buy the newest iPhone model every year, even though it’s a tiny amount more upgraded than the previous model. Americans also love buying clothes, we live in a society today where we are encouraged to keep in trend in fear that we will be out of the loop. I can say for myself that I have a lot of clothing, definitely way more than I need. There have been many occasions where I buy an outfit just to be able to wear it out once. Society has convinced us that we need to keep buying the newer and trendier things.  I agree with you that we are quick to get rid of items even when they are still usable, and therefore contributing to the issue of rampant consumerism. 
                    <br><br>

I have learned about planned obsolescence before, when Apple was accused of making  previous models of iPhones slower and more problematic to encourage consumers to buy the newest model. It’s despicable, this act of purposely sabotaging the quality of products and shortening their life spans.  It just shows how companies’ only intent is to make money, regardless of morals. They don’t care that by doing this is contributing to more and more waste. This just proves that companies don’t care about me, you, or the environment, they only care about profit.

Seeing the shift in consumerism was incredibly shocking. It obviously makes the most sense to use items like clothes until they fall apart. Americans, however, do not follow this idea and end up replacing clothes far before necessary. I was not aware of how guilty I was of this behavior until I looked into my closet to look at the clothes I have. I realized how many of my clothes stay back in the depths of my drawers and never get worn. As I buy new clothes based on fashion choices, my old clothes simply fall out of rotation and effectively become waste. This is a behavior that was almost subconscious, and I did not realize it until I forced myself to look at my behavior. Moving forward I hope to limit the number of new clothes I buy, continue to wear clothes for longer, and donate the clothes I do not need or wear. 

                    <br><br>

The concept of a company intentionally creating products that will fail and need replacement is extremely disheartening. It is a clear illustration of how companies value capital gain over the plant's health or their own customers' satisfaction. By producing products that intentionally fail, they are capable of selling more units and in turn, making more money, but they do this at the cost of our plant and customers. Not only do they produce more goods than necessary and create excess pollution on the production side, but they also create the waste of broken products that end up in landfills.

I agree that what these companies are doing is absolutely despicable. They don't have any pride in what they produce so long as its sold. There's no consideration for the environment or the consumer, just that they make their quick buck. These companies are creating this "rampant consumerism" as you put it on purpose and it's despicable. I like how you put it that most of our society can not be satisfied with what they have. You're right, they cannot. It's not so much that they will not or refuse to, it's that they literally can not be satisfied with what's on the market. It's an ugly cycle between buying cheap things and not saving enough money by the time that cheap thing has worn out to be able to afford something that's of better value and quality. 
                    <br><br>
I feel like Apple products (which I can't say I don't buy Apple products, I've got an apple phone, laptop, and AirPods so I'm definitely a ConsumerTM) are really bad at this too. In fact, I'm pretty sure they got caught using a battery that would purposely become less efficient and eventually die so that the phone was unusable and force the consumer to buy a new (and likely newer edition) phone. Apple also releases a new edition every year, with questionable "improvements" from the prior edition. There's nothing necessarily new or needed or super useful in each edition of the iPhone. It's just sparkly and new and gives you a higher status if you're one of the lucky ones who can afford that expensive of a phone at the time of its release.

I agree, I was also disgusted by the revelation that companies purposefully make things of a lower quality to increase the number of times we must purchase a new version of a product. While making these items poorly does allow them to be sold cheaply, thus making it easier for a consumer to buy more cheap products, it actually ends up costing the consumer, and our planet more in the long run. There is the common cliche of older individuals complaining that “back in their day” something was done differently or made better, and in this case, the cliche fits. Products seem to be becoming increasingly flimsy and sometimes even break apart within a month creating an ever growing mass of “dead”/consumed products.




<br><hr>

I was also shocked to actually read about the major shift in our culture. I live in this mass consumerist society, but to read about how much we buy for no reason other than unsatisfaction with the “old” and a desire for the “new” was shocking. It was alarming to reflect on my own purchases. Every few months I donate quite a few items of clothing because they are out of style or because I never even wore the item after I bought it. I shop and spend because I crave new additions to my closet. I get bored with my clothing collection rapidly and replace items far before they are no longer wearable. “The Waste Makers” included the statistic that 2/5 of the things we own are not essential to our well-being. We have an addiction to stuff, and it is poorly impacting the planet on which we live. 

                    <br><br>

 It was sad to reflect on my own experience with mass consumerism, but it was frustrating to hear of its origin. “Say’s Law” from the chapters we read is the fact that people will eagerly consume anything their nation’s economy produces. Companies and advertising agencies are the cause of this consumer culture. They plant this desire for more in our heads and use the power they have to encourage more purchases. The fashion industry embodies this idea of disposability. They created 52 seasons to ensure we would be bored of one skirt and need a new one within months. We are stuck in this destructive cycle of mass production and mass consumerism and simplification is crucial to both the environment and our economy.




<br><hr>
I agree that the mass production of intentionally poorly made items is despicable and dangerous. These items are usually made using very cheap resources, and sold for very cheap. I know that this low price is very attractive to potential buyers, and convinces them to buy things they don't need or buy the cheapest version of what they actually really need. In both cases, buying things you don't need just creates more waste and clutter, going back to the Henry David Thoreau reading, and buying the cheaply made version of what you actually need will probably be just as costly or even more expensive than purchasing a slightly more expensive item that is made of higher quality materials. Those cheap items break easily, and then you purchase more to replace the broken one. Repeating that cycle makes you spend more and more money unecessarily. That is why I am trying to avoid items that I know are cheap and will only serve me well in the short run; even if something is a little more pricey, it is usually worth it and your one-time purchase creates less waste on the planet.

After reading "The Waste Maker", I have come to the realization that consumerism is disastrous human addiction. After reading this it is now so clairvoyant the marketing schemes companies do in order to "improve" our life. An example from the text was the "improvement" of stoves. Companies make futile functions on the stove with more buttons and "functions" when in the end the stoves just do the same thing other stoves do. This ultimately causes people to want more and more because it is natural for humans to want the best in order to fit in even though it is literally a stove when the only function is to literally cook! Companies do this because they know we will want it and they are just money hungry and will do anything for money including ruining the environment for their selfish train of thought. I truly believe that consumerism is the ultimate cause of climate change. Consumerism has changed people's views about what they NEED when really they do not need any of it. Society has made people think they NEED to fit in and have all of these new styles just because other people do which is causing a cost to the environment. This not only makes me so heartbroken because it is costing our environment but also because it is sad they people must get the new and improved product in order to fit in or seem "normal" when really this is not what a normal human should even be worried about. After I have read these chapters it is really clear to me how consumerism is basically controlling society and the people being controlled have no realization. Of course, many people are aware of the climate crisis but I think we need to educate many on their out of hand consumerism. For example, I have watched many many YouTubers who are trying to be "environmentally friendly" with their reusable straws and bags and such which is great, however, on the other hand, they are buying endless products that are ultimately useless such as LED lights for behind their TV's when the lights in their house work just fine!

I agree with you, consumerism is an human addiction. My mom wanted this stove because it had a lot of buttons and it looked “cool”. I asked my mom about the buttons and she had no idea what they did. We bought it and till this day I still have no idea why that stove has like ten buttons. This is a prime example of how these companies use buttons to make the stove look better. I think about it now and I can not believe we fell for it, but then again everyone falls for these tricks from the companies.  Also I like how “Wasted Makers” does not talk about the environmental issues not because I do not believe in climate change but I like it because it shows how bad consumerism is. It tells us about these companies just advertise what we think we want. However if Vance Packard did talk about how bad consumerism is for the environment I feel like it would have a bigger impact. People are not really informed about how bad these companies are for the environment. If we were a bit informed maybe we would not want to buy these LED lights for our TV’s plus those lights are really distracting and give me headaches.

Although Vance Packard doesn't speak directly about how the consumer culture damages the environment, "The Waste Makers" still provides lots of insight and implications to how damaging the culture is.  He presents yet another perspective of how corporations and businesses put their profit over the priorities of everything else, and in this case, waste.  He argues and observes how industries have encouraged and built the US "throw away spirit" and the culture of having to go to a convenience store every week to buy more and restock on supplies.  I found it very interesting how engineers specifically design products to have "planned obsolescence," like an expiration date, making the consumer have to buy more of the product later after usage.  The innovators have also designed the obsolescence of desirability for products to sell more, which follows creating new styles or upgrades to products in order to sell to the consumer.  The reason behind these methods is that for many industries, in order for them to sell more they need to replace the things that people already have, and to do this, they have created business methods involving the practices involving making products obsolete.  Therefore, to encourage waste means to encourage production in order to replace, and this can be devastating to the environment.  Once again, there is a question of how to change a system that benefits the economy so well when it degrades the environment so much?  Again, the answer is that the system will have to change inevitably, the only question is if we change it ourselves or wait until environmental damage is irreversible and forces our hand.

There were many different points that I found alarming in Vance Packard's "The Wastemakers." Most importantly, however, this text is a reflection of American consumption, destruction, and greed that has become the identity of this country - a country that other developing countries look to as an example. For instance, the text gave many examples of common slogans spread through different outlets during the 50s to convince Americans that it was their duty to buy, such as "buy, buy, buy; it's your patriotic duty." Another quote that struck me and I think rings very true to American society is "whether the growth is particularly needed to promote the well-being of the American people is rarely even considered." I believe this quote really outlines the foundational problem with our capitalist system in America: as Ken outlined with the tobacco companies, corporations do not care for the well-being of Americans if it means they can make an extra buck. Customers are not seen as fellow human beings, but are selfishly exploited and disposed as a way to make money.

<br><br>
When I look at the way we consume physical products in this society, I can't help but think of the way we treat each other in American society. Consuming, disposing, and wasting so many physical things is a physical manifestation of how many people use and dispose of each other to gain some material wealth/success/power in our society. Look at our governing system - in politics, the LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY tear each other apart unabashedly to attain the power of the position they are seeking - is it truly to help other people? If we can't see the value in a jacket that can last 20 years, but we throw away after 2, how can we see the value in each other as human beings?

I agree that this reading was quite alarming and throughout this reading I could not help but think to myself that the methods companies use to make Americans purchase unnecessary things are incredibly smart and effective. They tend to go for American beliefs, which after WWII there was an increased amount of patriotism, as well as making the American people feel united which is very effective, especially with slogans like, "buy, buy, buy; it's your patriotic duty" (as American people). It is honestly incredible how the American people then and now are convinced that they need different colored clothing and matching sets, and a bathing suit for different occasions just to increase sales.
<br><br>
I also agree with your statement that customers are not seen as human beings but as another sale. With these amounts of sales they are making they are also making an incredible amount of waste which greatly affects our planet, yet they also do not care for that. Our economy was built entirely on the "need" to consume and in order to maintain the economy going company leaders would rather the planet suffer. And because of these reasons I find it hard to believe that companies would change their methods in order to help the planet.

Our reading this week Waste Makers by Vance Packer is a perfect example of how the American consumerist mindset started. People used to value the things they bought and owned them for a long period of time. But, now we are trained from an early age to buy, get tired of it, and buy more. I would hate to blame that on our generation because how could we know? This mindset has been taught to us since we were born and the reading addressed why this happens. Corporations and their advertisements have trained us to be consumer robots unaware of our destruction. The way automobile companies plan for their cars to break down over a period of time and other examples like this are a sad prevalent reality in our world today. This has been done to increase their profits and it has worked. 
<br><br>

Waste Makers was written in 1960 and these things were happening. Our world has changed so much since then but these problems are still beyond prevalent and much worse. This is a recurring issue in this class. Something may have been written 100 years ago warning us of consumerism or climate change but here we are continuing to reinforce the issue. Why do we do this? It’s pretty simple, our constant need for new goods is continuing to kill our planet. But, we can’t stop because we strive to own the best of the best to make us happy. This lifestyle has now been passed down for generations and it will be very hard to change it. This cultural issue must be changed at some point because at the rate we are going our consumption is not going to slow down anytime soon.

Vance Packard’s “Waste Makers” highlights the major factors that have driven the rise in consumerism in America. I found this piece quite interesting, as I have only ever seen and understood today’s relationship with consumerism, where people have a sometimes subconscious need for more and better stuff. Packard reveals this modern trend stemmed way back from the fifties after the recession hit and stock prices dropped. In order to stimulate, and thus rescue, the economy, the government and marketers challenged the public to buy things, anything, to put more money into circulation. This technique seemed to work at the time, but it was soon continued even after being necessary. Thus, consumerism has continued to increase since the fifties until now, becoming more of a lifestyle rather than a necessity. Through this piece, we can see the chronological shift from a simple stimulation of the economy to the becoming of a wasteful and unappreciative society that is always in want but was long ago sufficed. It seems that with such easy access to items anywhere, anytime, for very low prices, much less value is placed in caring for these things and much more is wasted. For example, as Packard mentioned, people may accidentally throw away their potato peelers, but this is nothing to worry about because it is so easily replaceable. Later, Packard moves on to introduce the concept of “planned obsolescence,” where a product is not easily replaced, but instead, a more valuable and expensive product becomes outdated and is in need of upgrade. Therefore, the consumer must continue to come back to the seller every now and again to stay up to date with the latest and greatest version of an item they already possess. It was quite intriguing and, honestly, scary to see how the concept of consumerism has progressed so cleverly and never ceases to pull in the public and keep people constantly coming back for more.

I agree with your view on this week's reading. I thought that it was very interesting to see how the rise of Consumerism came to be in America. To me it was particularly interesting to contrast how consumerism was back when this book was published and how it is today. I found that there really are not many differences in the consumerism culture between the two. Something that Packard mentioned was the concept of "planned obsolescence." As soon as I read that I instantly thought about the iPhones. When you buy and iPhone it is usually expected to last only 2 or 3 years if you are lucky. Apple ensures this because every time that a new update comes out it appears to make previous iPhones slower and less efficient. This to me showed how the same concepts are being used today in order to get the general public to consume more that were used back then. I thought that although thus book was written quite a while ago it is very relevant to our time and the society that we live in today. Something else that popped out to me when reading the five chapters of this book is how the industry was really not interested in anything else but making profit. Looking back on this today I can see how our planet became so polluted and really how much and how easily Americans began producing waste and how this quickly became an issue.

In Vance Packard's The Waste Makers, it was fascinating to observe the manner in which showcasing and commercialization works. It is clear that individuals today are getting more materialistic and we are currently devouring twice as much as World War II. Individuals are purchasing significantly more stuff than they really need. As first presented peoples assets are taking over homes. Additionally, commercialization has raised because of how quick the creation procedure has become, and how quick organizations can deliver and sell their items. I think different organizations are presently attempting to follow a similar creation model since fast organizations have gotten exceptionally effective

The U.S. consumerism increases a lot in the years separating from the Second World War, it was quickly changing to what Packard called a waste machine. And we are increasingly buying more stuff and quickly throw away them, this is a huge waste of resources and it will also cause damage to our environment. Packard pointed out a fact that we should all pay attention to which is that all sorts of additional industries were jumping on the fashion bandwagon. And he used automobiles as an example, they change cars every two or three years in a successful effort to sell more cars, but in the process, more and more waste is created. It is terrible to know that the company always choose their needs over consumers, and the tobacco industry even got into the business of making consumers out of children just to keep their profits up. This abnormal consumerism definitely need to be changed, how to change it? I think the answer can be found in one of the previous lectures Ken talked about, which is fundamentally reinventing Western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that happiness is to be found in things. We should all put in actions and make changes.

In western society consumerism dominates all aspects of our lives. The book The Waste Makers delves into the various ways consumers are controlled by industries and encouraged to keep buying and discarding. On average two fifths of things we own are non essential luxury items. This is mostly due to the high levels of production and the way industries find ways to continue to create demand for new and improved luxury items. Marketers of companies started selling the idea that people needed more than one product for different scenarios. The book also talks a lot about the idea of planned obsolescence which is a policy of producing consumer goods that will eventually become obsolete and require replacing. This concept drives the cycle of excessive consumerism. Many product producers also employ death dating when creating a product. Death dating is when companies engineer a product to “die” or become unstable after a certain time to encourage repurchasing.

If "The True Cost" documentary laid out the consequences of the first world's excessive consumerism, then "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard explains how we got to this point. He discusses how corporate America tried to fix the overproduction issue post World War II by pushing the public toward materialism and credit. It's odd to know that we are consuming twice the amount that Americans did before World War II. The chapters showcased how companies and manufacturers manipulated us with marketing, and how that snowballed into the wasteful culture we have today. I thought it was especially insidious to instill the idea that a product was obsolete as soon as a new version of it came out, regardless of whether said item was still usable or not. Instead of lowering their output when faced with less demand, these companies decided to coerce the people into thinking that they needed more of what they frankly didn't, furthering unsustainable ways of living.

Not only did this book tell me that we live in a consuming culture but the shocking thing to me was that it was planned this way. This is almost an ethically different stance. Producing things not the best way you know how but to have them turn obsolete so people have to buy a newer version of it. This is almost plain evil. Designing something not because you lik the craft or are intrinsically motivated to help the people that buy the product but solely to make as much money, long term as you possibly can. This is the root of capitalism convincing people that they need more stuff. I once saw a fragment of a adolescent boy that told the camera crew that he always buys about five charger cable's on wish because he calculates how long they will last on average and then  according to that accepts their lifespan because they are cheap. He has adapted himself so much to the consumers culture that he now knowingly buys product with a really short lifespan just because they are cheap. In my opinion this is everything that is wrong with consumerism.

"The Waste Makers" was a very thorough explanation of consumerism and what had to be done in the past in order for the obsession of consumption and disposal to become so normal in today's society. It exemplifies how destructive and poisonous the capitalistic way of life has become to our world, especially with the quote "physical possessions are becoming too plentiful to accommodate comfortably." People have the compulsion to buy more and more things that they don't need and then don't have the space to store it all in an organized matter, leading to the need for bigger houses, bigger garages, bigger everything. It blew my mind to learn that simple things such as color matching in the fashion industry to creating new models of cars each year can create such rampant consumerism that people literally don't know what to do with it other than throw it away. I agree with Professor Hiltner's point about how easy it is to give into this way of life when one is born into it because things like a new iPhone every year, a new model of a wide variety of cars seemed like no big deal to me up until learning about the climate crisis and taking this course.
<br><br>


With smartphones specifically, I've always wondered why they come up with new versions each year when most likely, they have the modified versions figured out for the next few years already. Instead of putting all their new ideas into one model, they space it out to make more money and create a significant amount of e-waste. This is to ensure their profits keep coming in and they don't run out of new innovative ideas as mentioned in the reading regarding home appliances. What's more notable, this problem will only get worse as time goes on as the reading mentions "Tomorrow, more than ever, our life will be 'disposable.'" Mostly everything on the market today follows this spaced out plan of innovation to harness more profits at the cost of the environment and because it has become so normalized, not many people see an issue with it. In fact, they are obsessed with the "next big thing" without considering the consequences.

I totally agree that capitalism is destructive and poisonous. When the main goal of our society is to make money, there’s no room for actually caring about humanity. Instead of seeing each other as part of a community, we see each other as opportunities for profit. It’s hard to think of any industry that’s much better than the tobacco industry (also, they’re still doing the same stuff, just with bubblegum flavored vapes). It’s definitely powerful to read about the true goals of industry players and the strategy that goes into selling as much stuff as possible in The Waste Makers. They’re really good at it, so good at it that we accept their advertising as American culture.

Maybe to completely solve this problem, we need to change our whole mindset, but I think for now we can advocate for sanctions on industry. Planned obsolescence is a violation of consumer rights, and we can advocate for that. We can also advocate for a circular economy, in which companies need to clean up the waste that comes from their own products. Once we make companies internalize the external costs that all of us have to deal with (climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, etc), industry will have to change their game or they’ll stop making money. And it seems like that’s all they care about, so we have to go that route. Someone just today told me how Amazon funnels most of their profits through a European firm so that they don’t have to pay high American taxes. Let’s make that illegal. How do we do that? We need to elect government officials that will actually fight for their constituents, not industry. So we all need to vote!! If elected officials knew that they couldn’t win by supporting industry, they wouldn’t do it. We have to use our grassroots power to change the system to work for us, not the big money-makers.

After reading “The Waste Makers” by Vance Packard, I was truly astonished by the wealth of information and awareness the public had even though this article was published more than sixty years ago. The way older generations have described climate change seemed as if they had no idea that buying the latest Bel Air would mean more pollution or buying two refrigerators would waste more water. It seemed as if they had no idea their actions would have dire consequences. After reading this, however, I am absolutely furious. In 1950 alone there were more cars than there were families in the United States. Producers sold replacements and created an improved product that will make the families want to buy the new edition.  This information and similar publications were made public thus people in this generation and those before had to have known what they were doing was affecting the environment. Americans are convinced that they deserve the right to luxury items because it is the American dream however it is just an obsession to consumerism and capitalism. However, I recognize that the public was not truly the one to blame, but the economists and owners of production companies who wanted to boost the economy. The United States economy after WWII was built on three plans of obsolescence. First the obsolescence of function that means whenever an existing product becomes outmoded a new product will be built to function better. Second the obsolescence of quality that means a product will be prone to break down or wear out at a given time. And finally the third the obsolescence of desirability when a product is still of quality but there is a new, flashier product. It is saddening to see that Americans for the better part of a century have tied their appearances to material wealth rather than their personal values and achievements. Thus we can see that 1950s American consumerism created the waste machine that we see today. We were born in a time that made buying luxury items and more of it made not only sense but trendy. The United States' government sees the color green as symbol of money not green for the environment.

I completely agree with your comment. Constantly buying new and improved items is just an obsession to consumerism and capitalism. I believe that our consumerism society has become so advanced that it is considered to be ‘normal’ to try and buy the latest and newest luxurious stuff. It is considered to be an accomplishment as it represents success; success is deemed as power. Company owners are extremely intelligent as they know the exact ways to manipulate an individual into buying their product. They create these products in order to advance their own personal political agenda by obtaining money and power. Their engineers and technicians know exactly how to manipulate an item in order for it to go bad or break. This documentary immediately led me to think of the phone industries, they are constantly creating new updates (which make your phone run slower the older it is) and add on simple effects in order to appeal to the eyes of consumers which make them want that item. In reality, their are no major changes, all the products basically have the same function and abilities. One specific company that is a perfect example for performing planned obsolescence is the iPhone. Another example could be companies who make their products from cheaper material in order for them to break down more easily. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, it was crazy to hear the older generations talk cluelessly as if their actions do not have consequences. The tobacco companies are a perfect example of these individuals contributing to this harmful product.


<br><hr>
There should be more documentaries on positive ways in which individuals can create a healthy lifestyle for themselves and the environment. They should really take into consideration a natural and healthy lifestyle by growing our own crops or having community garden and saving energy.

I think that the fact that this reading came before much of the environmental movement is actually really important in proving that our consumerism goes beyond just hurting the environment. Even if you do not care about the environmental impact of consumerism, this reading makes it very clear that America's obsession with material goods is wasteful in terms of money, resources, and time. We are allowing ourselves to be manipulated by industries and losing self control more and more. We are also getting lazier because we continually buy products that do things we could easily do ourselves. According to the reading, the "American housewife is dreaming of the day when she can prepare breakfast by simply flicking a bedside switch". This is not something necessary, but everyone wants technology to solve all their problems and minor inconveniences. I think laziness is a major root of the problem of consumerism, in addition to manipulation from industry. Thus, both the companies and the consumers are at fault.
<br><br>

I found the "There's Always Room for More" chapter to be particularly interesting because it focuses on how companies have made the consumer feel as though they need different products for different occasions or moods even though the same product would normally suffice. The companies also aimed at convincing the consumer that others would look down on them for not getting specific items or not having multiple items that essentially are the same besides style or color. This is very intriguing to think about because it really has affected so many aspects of life, like fashion, real estate, cars, and more. 
<br><br>

The quote in Ch 5, "ending is better than mending" from "Brave New World" stood out to me because I though about how historically, the vast majority of people were taught how to sew and mend things from a fairly young age. Nowadays, we maybe take one home economics class in middle school and forget much of what we learn after. I would have no idea how to mend an article of clothing myself. We are not only getting new things that we do not need, but we are failing to learn important skills that could limit our waste. As with many other aspects of the climate crisis, I think that it is crucial that the education system takes more responsibility in teaching children from a young age how to avoid unhealthy consumerism and limit waste.

I completely agree with you. Even from a young age, I believe much of our youth can and is convinced that the more you have the better. It’s somewhat scary to think about how advertisers are that convincing. As a child, I would always want a new toy that served the same purpose as the ones I already had. Consumerism has been taught to us and now we flock to stores to buy unnecessary things hoping that it will fill some void that you have. Companies have gotten so powerful and persuasive that many of us don’t think twice about buying whatever it is that they are promoting. It’s even crazier to think that they were able to do this with items that cost a lot of money, such as cars and appliances. 
 <br><br>

Your comment on sewing and mending was very interesting. I never thought of this as an idea that can lead our consumerist culture to live more of a resourceful and wasteless life. I think it is a great idea to teach young kids about waste and the importance of where our clothes, food, etc come from. The damage done by consumerism is masked very well, and the more we educate people on the clandestine plans of big corporations, the more empowered the consumer will become.

In The Waste Makers, Packard explains that in order to sustain the United States’ quickly-expanding and increasingly powerful economy, businesses had to reshape the average consumer’s relationship with the products they buy. Instead of valuing simple, quality products that provide utility for many years, consumers were indoctrinated with a “throwaway” attitude, and made to believe that everything could, and should, be replaced. One way this was accomplished was by designing products around the idea of ultra-convenience: ready-to-eat meals, single-use clothing, and consumables such as lipstick and whip cream cans were praised for being easy to use and readily available, despite costing more money. Decreasing product lifespan increased sales volume and stimulated economic growth; accordingly, modest & simple lifestyles became incompatible with this agenda of “infinite” growth and were actively discouraged. The idea that material goods are a requisite for happiness became embedded within the American dream. It is hard to truly appreciate and not take for granted what you have when you are surrounded by the message that spending more money to have more things is good and necessary for success. As Thoreau suggested in Walden, “The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad, and if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior.” While the ultimate responsibility falls on yourself in determining what your needs and wants are, Packard’s commentary on American consumer culture really made it clear just how much power corporations have when it comes to shaping people’s values. Overall, I believe that a significant amount of responsibility falls on these companies in finding a middle ground between avoiding wastefulness and over-exploitation of consumers, and using productive (if used correctly) tactics such as planned obsolescence to encourage the development of technology and overall improve the usefulness of products.

One point that interested me the most in the reading "The Waste Maker" by Vance Packard was "planned obsolescence".  Planned obsolescence is connected with the consumer's want to buy more product so the company makes more money. And the company will do anything to make more money. Packard sites three things in making a product obsolete: function, quality, and desirability. Desirability is the king of making products obsolete in today's market. Planned obsolescence interested me the most because I began to connect all of his points to modern-day technology and fashion. I only realized how much worse it is today with more and more products. The first product that came to mind was apple products.  It is so apparent to me that every decision Apple makes to "improve" their iPhones is really a move to make the last phone undesirable and make them more money. For instance, when Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone everyone erupted in anger. People questioned why Apple would do that because it made their consumer base mad, but in reality, it made them more money because people are forced to buy AirPods now to fight the inefficiency of having no headphone jack.

"Growthmanship" states that as the economy grows, both production and consumption must grow with it scares me for the future. This hints that the tactics companies have had to use in the past to force a substantial increase in consumerism will be ongoing and become more slimy in order to increase profits in the future.  This is the state of mind that we have to break as the new generation if we are going to make an impact on helping the climate crisis. I believe we have built the starting bricks of the path in order to change the state of mind but there is a lot more to go to finish. There will have to be a major shock in my opinion in order to truly change the new generation.

It’s crazy to me all of the thought and effort that companies put into creating fads and trends. Planned obsolescence is a manipulative tactic to make people bend at corporations’ wills. As you mentioned, Packard credits function, quality, and desirability to determining obsolescence – and it couldn’t be more accurate. However, in today’s day and age, businesses focus on making more “desirable” products, and they do so under the guise of functionality. Building off of your example of Apple products, in the past few years, Apple removed the home button from the iPhone, instead, creating an entirely touch screen retina display by which certain swipes could accomplish what the home button used to. Of course, they made it seem like having the entire screen used for displays instead of wasting space with a home button was more functional, but in reality, it’s just more desirable. The newer iPhones look more sleek, less bulky, more minimalistic (in the aesthetic sense of the word). Did we really need the extra inch or so of space on our screens? Definitely not. But we wanted it. And that’s exactly what companies capitalize on: our desire for new, different, and more “functional”.

Reading about the history of our consumerist culture was almost disgusting. The several slogans aimed at the American public to encourage them to “buy, buy, buy” felt disingenuous and pressuring. The fact that corporations produce more than consumers can buy is already scary enough, but when you factor “growthmanship” into the equation, this becomes an insurmountable obstacle to the well being of our economy, our society, and our environment especially. Fostering this culture of waste only leads to more production which leads to more greenhouse gas emissions. The only solution I can think of is to start buying less and doing so more intentionally, which means possibly spending a little more money to get an item that is good quality, lasts long, and is ethically sourced so we do not continue to perpetuate this cycle of waste.

When I read the champers from this book I could not help but to think of the song Trust your Mechanic by the Dead Kennedys. This song details how people trick consumers into buying their products or pay them more money. The stand out line is "Trust your mechanic to mend your car
 <br><br>
 Bring it in to his garage, He tightens and loosens a few spare parts, One thing's fixed, another falls apart, And the rich eat you". It's one thing to listen to a liberal punk band from the 80's, its another to realize that they were right. While reading I could not help but to feel like I had heard this before, because I had, this idea was not new to me and I was disgusted. The book published in 1960, had the same content as the song did 22 years later in 1982, then in 2020, we are still talking about this. 
 <br><br>
This is now a part of American culture, buying just to buy. Our parents and grandparents were convinced to take part in this system of constantly buying and now it is part of America itself. The worst part is it was not entirely their fault. They were relentlessly advertised and convinced to buy buy buy. Other times the products they bought just broke after a certain amount of time. I was disgusted to read about the 'new ethics' of engineering that designed things to break. An engineer should strive to make things as sturdy and well made as possible. Their job is not to make profit, its to build things. What were our parents and grandparents to do when the only cars sold to them guzzled gas at 15 miles per gallon and whipped cream cans that did not dispense all the cream inside (the same ones sold today). The consumer is not at fault for this culture of waste, it is the corporations and people who forced it on us to  keep the US economy growing after world war II.

After reading "Waste Makers", my mind has not changed in regards to how big an issue overconsumption is and the way we are so wasteful.
 <br><br>

I think back on my own lifestyle and I reflect on how I used to buy so many pieces of clothing, caps, and all that. 
 <br><br>

There is so much advertisement and brainwashing that companies feed our minds in order to profit from working people’s need to uphold a façade. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The only way the poor escape the reality of the system is to buy and buy cheap trinkets and clothing to numb the sadness of it all.  This business of exploitation nd wastefulness is destroying our planet.

I think “planned obsolescence” is the major concept that is being discussed in Chapter 2-7 in the book The Waste Maker. The author did a good job explaining the business mechanisms behind consumerism, which somehow scared me a little bit because I felt very manipulated after reading the book. I wasn’t aware that producers might intentionally shorten the products’ lifespan or reduce their quality just to induce the consumers to replace these items more frequently and make more purchase; I wasn’t aware that “planned obsolescence” could bring together such a long chain of interest including furniture producers, electrical appliance sellers, real estate sellers, land mower producers, and so on; I wasn’t aware that disposable products are not just designed for convenience but moreover to “exploit laziness”. 

 <br><br>

To me, the worst part of “planned obsolescence” is not just that people are throwing away things that can still function but just out of style or are worn out, creating waste that are extremely detrimental to the environment (non-degradable materials, enormous amount of carbon releasing and etc.), but the potentiality that this trend is engraining consumerist culture and creating a habit of consuming at a higher price, product complexity, and frequency. People’s desires are growing ever so rampantly. The true thing to think about is: should we be proud of this or should we see it as a dangerous signal? Undoubtedly, it could be pushing the economic development, stimulating innovations, elevating people’s living standard, but is this a fair trade-off for exchange of all the other consequences? Deceit from companies, exaggerations in excessive advertisement, huge environmental damages…would it really be worthwhile to establish such a culture? More importantly, how moral is the process of establishing this culture? The author quoted a reader’s protest after reading his journal: “Science devises junk; industry mass-produces it; business peddles it; advertising conditions our reflexes to reach for the big red box of it.” My opinion is that we should stop this “infection” immediately, although it’s impossible to do so immediately, but pulling the brake is better than accelerating.

When reading this planned obsolescence also really stood out to me and seemed the most shocking. Their strategic planning of making a product to be obsolescence and then their marketing to make that product desirable is yes, of course, awful for the environment yet still so business-wise, smart.  They make Americans their puppets, they have us at the control of their fingertips, that's the sad truth. Your comment about "people's desires are growing so ever rampantly" I couldn't agree more, but the reason for this is these large corporations. As Americans, we are wired and have that throwing away spiritual mentality. Corporations are teaching us to be like this and we're teaching our children.  Getting away from this seems nearly impossible. I think the best thing we can do as consumers is to educate ourselves, buy and spend money more consciously and make sure to pass this to our kids, to our parents, to our friends.  While out-smarting these big corporations may seem intimidating, small steps from consumers making conscious educated purchases can truly go along way. As noted in the article "many hundreds of American companies still do their very best to give their buyers a long-lasting product, especially in fields not heavily dependent upon replacement sales."

Planned obsolescence is a practice that is really hard for me to wrap my head around. It seems that it is almost the complete opposite of technological innovation. Instead of designing and creating things to be more useful, companies design things to quickly fade in functionality and style. It really seems to be counter intuitive fir a good society. Unfortunately this is an excellent tool for companies to use since it will keep them competing and ultimately keep their profits up. I find optimism in companies that are starting to change the mantra and bring back the roots of quality over quantity. I like Patagonia for example because although they are a fashion company, their clothing has proven to last much longer than many other companies and just as importantly stay in style throughout the years. Perhaps if more companies saw that consumers value this way of doing things, then they too would change and create high quality products meant to be practical and have a meaningful longevity.

I definitely agree with your point on ‘planned obsolescence’ although I knew that it was a thing a long time ago. Of course, it’s not something that’s always on my mind though so it’s not like I am constantly aware of the fact of companies intentionally reduce their products’ lifespans and/or quality so that consumers will buy more. One example that kind of blew my mind that I only learned about very recently was car air fresheners. Like the tree ones that you hang onto your rear view mirror that give off a particular scent such as pine to make your car smell good: a friend of mine claimed that those products are specifically designed to, after a certain amount of time, lose their scent and start giving off a mildly unpleasant odor that will make your car smell worse. Then, you will think that the product has been used up and it’s time to go buy another one to make your car smell good again! And of course this only propagates the cycle further and further. Of course, my friend just claimed this to me and I don’t know whether this is true or not. But, the bottom line is that companies and corporations have shown, time and time again, that they are more than willing to throw their consumers to the curb in an effort to generate more profit. I haven’t done any research and have no proof about the car air fresheners, but it definitely would not be surprising to me to find out that it is indeed true. 
 <br><br>


As another commenter pointed out, planned obsolescence is literally like the opposite of technological innovation. It’s really sad to see that in the modern era, at least in the developed countries that all of these companies and major corporations come from, people really do forsake their principles, morals, and values in the interest of making money.



<br><hr>
I am really glad you decided to discus the concept of planned obsolesce in your comment as I too was deeply impacted by its wasteful tactics. To me, this concept is not a new one and actually something I have thought about quite a bit. Much like the analogy of the jacket used in this article, I have seen myself and others disregard a usable object simply because repairing it would not be worth its over all cost. We see this in almost every aspect of consumerism, however, the most important product that suffers this phenomenon today is arguably the car. It is quite evident how the value of a car (while sky rocketing monetarily) has decreased greatly over the past 60 years. The concept of the "family car" that is passed down for generations is a thing of the past. We also see this in the decline of "classic cars." This is because the car is often disgarded  before it can aquire any sence of sentimentality to it in order to become a family car or a classic car. Nowadays it is almost certain that a minor car accident will result in the totalling of a vehicle, and, conversly the mechanic industry is declining because people would rather replace their cars than fix them. This is wildly important when you consider the waste that is produced by a fast pased car industry like the one we have today. In the US there are more cars than people who are able to drive, and each car produces between 17 and 34 metric tons of CO2 in manufacturing. Thus, when these ideas are taken into conjunction, our abuse of the car industry is arguably one of our most detrimental forms of consumerism.

I agree with you. The reading points out "planned obsolescence," which really alarms me. The strategies of producers are influencing consumers to buy more products intentionally. While more products are developed, it is hard for consumers to get desires fulfilled. We consumers should think about if we really need some products rather than following the trend or attracted only by its advertisements. Now producers always spread the idea that the money we spent is a kind of investment for ourselves. We are self-improving by throwing money in the unnecessary products and it is ridiculous, isn't it? However, the good thing is that there are companies are realizing the importance of making products durable. The ideas of improving products are not the opposite of making products durable.



<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. It is mind blowing to read about the manipulation that corporations plan in order to increase consumption and waste. As I was reading "The Waste Makers", I felt bad that I understood it, because a lot of people perhaps do not. Maybe it is because they refuse to acknowledge that what they enjoy doing (purchasing) can have such a bad effect. They can be in denial of the harm that they are doing to our planet, just like some people are in denial of climate change. I was shocked at how consumerism culture has been defined by how much hazardous waste we create. It is no longer built by the need for survival and healthy enjoyment but it is now defined by how much stuff we own even when we do not need it. 
 <br><br>


The entire concept of planned obsolescence now makes more sense to me. Prior to reading these chapters, I already knew that there were goods that had different 'durability'. I always thought that cheaper things were meant to last a little amount of time, or that were meant for a quick use. However, I know realize that companies purposely manipulate a products durability to increase sales and profits. As much as this angers me because of the financial and environmental burdens that this causes, us consumers are also to blame. If we did not have a desire of purchasing items based on its looks or what it means in society, these corporations would not succeed in these tactics. As the book states, "Americans are prone to accept newness as betterness". By industries using this psychological approach, they are not only harming the people but also the planet. And that is the worst thing. It is no longer only the fashion industry that is playing with our minds. It is every industry that sees the effects of it. As the future of our planet is becoming more and more unsure, we need to realize that everything we do has a consequence, that is the cost of living. We need to reinvent the way we let society influence us. As consumers, we have the power in the economy, and we have to start acting like it.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your disgust about the planned obsolescence surrounding things that are fully functional but out of style or having a used appearance.  The widespread nature of planned obsolescence not only across our industries but riddled throughout our culture is terrifying and I fully support your comment that we need to pull the brake on this cultural phenomenon. I like that you also listed the possible advantages that were described as a counterpoint in the chapters and I think when explicitly reading these advantages next to the obvious disadvantages it becomes even more clear that we need to move away from the culture chock full of planned obsolescence. I also liked the quote that you chose to include that was placed in these chapters from a reader’s protest because it outlines just how deep the planned obsolescence of consumerism goes throughout our society.  It is clear from this quote that a fight against consumerism is a fight against industry, business, and advertising.
  <br><br>
Another interesting point that Ken made is that through advertising and its targeting of children, we have almost no choice in the matter of falling into and participating in this consumerist culture. This reminded me of something my economics professor told me last quarter. She said that she didn’t let her children watch any commercials for the first part of their lifetime. At first, I thought she was crazy for this but now I understand that this is something that could actually be saving her children’s lives.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you! The Waste Makers by Vance Packard was a very eye-opening read. What I found interesting was also the concept of planned obsolescence. To know that products are made to not last as long as they should just so people can go back and have to buy it again or something better is crazy to think about. We are then in this cycle where once something seems to not be useful anymore, we go back and buy it all over again. This kinda reminds me of the scandal that happened with Apple products where it was said they slowed down older iPhone models just so users would have to go and buy the more recent phones. We should be buying products meant to last longer to not only limit our spending but the waste it has on our environment. Some people also feel the need to buy the newest or the best looking things just to have it. This is extremely wasteful and many people often do not even use what they buy. This hurts our environment by producing the products and then not properly disposing of them afterward. I agree that people’s desires are only growing faster and faster and we should do something to help limit the waste we create.



<br><hr>
I also find out the same facts that you describe in the first paragraph and I also agree with you about stopping the rampant consumerism to achieve a better society and environment. The text reminds me that we are developing a habit of intentionally discarding the stuff we once loved. It is also normal to connect this reading to Thoreau's definition of "good life" and "happiness". Packard points out that two-fifths of the stuff bought by the average American are not essential to their life. If Thoreau were here, he would be telling the average American that this is not the way to achieve the American dream. What Thoreau believes is that people only need the basic elements to have a good standard of living and anything else and excess is no more than adding more burdens. I find this extremely useful and meaningful in this context. If we consider what Thoreau argues here, we would have figure out a solution to rampant consumerism and the situations won't be getting worse day by day. I believe Thoreau's idea of simplicity is the true panacea for changing our ingrained belief in consumption and move to a more environmentally-friendly habit.

After reading the article " The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I totally agree with you. The term "Plan Obsolescence" leaves a deep impression to me. People nowadays are developing a trend that is rather to replace the broken stuff, not to repair them. It is detrimental to the environment, since during this kind of process by millions of thousands of people, hundreds of tons of waste has been dumped into landfill. This is also ubiquitous in China, with the development of technology and economy, people are able to consume more than they need to. What all human on Earth should do right now is to "simplify" our life, not mentally, but physically. We have to purchase the things we need, and stop generating unnecessary wastes. Moreover, the wastes which dumped into landfill takes millions of years to decompose, and some wastes even highly toxic to Earth, and may pollute our environment, creating threat to life-form.



<br><hr>
One product or brand that I think plays a big role in the idea of "planned obsolescence" is Apple.  Every year Apple comes out with a brand new phone with little differences in functionality.  However, these minor new features easily win over consumers so much that they made a program where one can sign up and get a new phone every year.  Plenty of people are in this program because they just absolutely want the new phone so they can have the new latest features.  When they only had their phone for only one year and it works perfectly fine.  A phone usually can last about 2-5 years depending on how much the phone is being taken care of.  This is creating a lot of electronic waste, however, Apple has combatted this by telling people to recycle their phones with them and they will dispose of the phone properly or use the parts to make new phones.  
 <br><br>


Now to go off the idea of companies making products that do not work just so the next year the consumer will buy the next product.  I think this is true and false.  I think a good understanding must be made about the topic.  Companies are yes making products that do not necessarily work after 3 months but are trying to make technological innovations.  I think most people see all the innovations in these new products and that is what makes them buy them.  So I do not think a company is just only making products that lack functionality because if that is the only thing they are doing they would have gone out of business a long time ago.  But they haven't because they are still trying to make innovations in their products and that is why people still consume the products.



<br><hr>
I completely agree with your point of view on planned obsolesence. I think it is incredibly sad that designs are made to break. I see this most with phones. IPhone and other phone brands are very guilty of this. I found it annoying that I had to recently upgrade a perfecty good phone simply because the technology on my old one wouldn’t work well enough for me to keep it. It is also really hard to keep up with all of this because the prices of phones goes up each time. But it is the price that we have to pay to still have the same type of phones with the capabilities we need. And I think this planned obsolescence fuels the mass consumerism that we face in this day and age.

However, although I have just made this point, I also think that this idea that I needed a new phone to keep up with the capabilities that I ’needed’ is also a construct. I think that we have somehow wired our brains differently so that we think we need our phones to be able to do so many things. Essentially we now carry around mini computers, alongside our laptops, and desktops, and whatever other technological items we have convinced ourselves that we need. This is another factor that fuels consumerism. As new phones and laptops etc. get released with new capabilities and new fancy features, we often get forced through the planned obsolesence to have to force ourselves to upgrade.

I agree that planned obsolescence is a problem. Obviously the fashion industry is a big problem with the replacement of clothes so frequently. But I think the tech industry is a really big problem. Whenever a new phone comes out people have to buy it even though they bought a new one not even a year before. A lot of people just want it to have the social status where in reality it gives them maybe a second or two of clout. I believe it's wildly irresponsible for us to buy things just to keep up with the times when what we had worked just fine.

Unchecked consumerism. The Waste Makers is particularly important and special in that it is written by an author, Vance Packard, whom offers himself to his audience not as an environmentalist, but as someone who has lived through the times of cultural change rather than just being born into it. This factor alone brings so much depth into what he has to say as it allows him to offer his perspective as someone who has witnessed the raw change. To even further the contrast, he literally grew up during the time of the Great Depressions where his idea of normal circled around using everything to the max, whereas compared to the consumerism spread anything new was in, and was in high demand, craved by those that wanted to fit in. When I first started reading this, going into it, the first things that crossed my mind were clothing and technology (take iPhones). But bringing up the automobile example was incredibly eye opening to me as I learned of the change that were made to these cars and advertising. Planned obsolescence, like those companies that little think of their consumers, knowing they are wasting money, making waste, and perhaps even killing themselves, is a dangerous trap. Growing up already in this culture, consumerism always seemed normal. I was born into it. I always use this example, but it’s a true thing, that after watching Marie Kondo and her lifestyle, I have since been opened to so many Asian minimalist YouTubers who share their simple, clean, and refreshing lifestyles, day to day, clear of clutter, but with just enough of everything- only keeping the things that sparks joy in their life. Everything really snowballs when you starts cluttering and cluttering with no end, especially with clothing, which I felt particularly guilty of, and have since started to sell and donate, decluttering my materialistic lifestyle, to keep only what I need and really want. It’s crossed my mind many times how much waste we’ve accumulated which just boggles my brain. So much pollution, where does all our waste go? Recycling only does so much- I hope we lower our consumerism and find the appeal to sustainable practices soon.

This is an issue that goes hand in hand with fast fashion, although it is on a much bigger scale. Housing, grocery stores, shopping centers take up so much space because of capitalism pitting them against each other when one or two buildings devoted to selling those products to condense space and allow for more important things like housing, hospitals, and even gardens or centers for reforestation. The idea that bigger is better has crippled a large part of our country, allowing the rich to thrive and the poor to suffer. Celebrities and billionaires hoard space and money from the rest of the population, and often make the working class feel like we are the ones that need to fix our problems. I remember not long ago an ad with Billie Eillish and Woody Harrelson talking about the dangers of the climate crisis and calling for the public to take action, as if they aren’t living with way more than any one person or family needs. Everyone is contributing to the issue of making waste, but the biggest contributors are making the rest of us feel like it’s our fault and our job to fix it.

I was amazed that Vance Packard’s book The Waste Makers was so spot on for a book that was made in the 1960s. I actually couldn’t believe how well Packard was able to identify the problem of consumerism in America even though I feel like we’re told time and time again how little we knew about these problems back then. It seems to me that like Ken said previously, we did know exactly what we were doing even in decades past. Whether it was designing products to purposely fail or pushing Americans to buy more goods by over-saturating a market for a product, big businesses and corporations knew exactly what they were doing and how they were going to do it. Reading some of the chapters of this book today remind me of how unsurprised I should be considering the reputations that big business has. Consumerism in America has run rampant everywhere that it could. What struck me was when Packard started to discuss the idea of throwing away or disposable items. These companies were producing things to just be thrown away. This not only increased the amount of waste that Americans contributed but it also meant that Americans were going to buy more and more things just to throw those things away and buy more things. The concept I hate most of all is the idea of  durability obsolescence. I say this because I think of how unfair it must be to consumers and people all over the world to buy a product that is made to break at a specific time or after some amount of use. I couldn’t imagine spending thousands of dollars on a water heater unit one year and having to replace it the next 2 years. Another idea that stuck out to me was the mention of the salesmen who would come around, offer free inspections of a fireplace or other household item, and then proceed to tell the owner of the home how inadequate it is and how it should be replaced right away. These ideas were not only wrong but they developed such a lust of consumerism among Americans that it is a partial cause of why we as Americans buy so much stuff to this day.

Wow, I did not realize that the book was made so long ago. I thought at most it would have been written in the 1980's or 1990's. I emphasize with your disgust on the planned obsolescence. However I do not think you have to imagine spending so much money on a water heater only to have to replace it after 2 years. After all we are forced to do the same thing with our smartphones. Apple has even admitted to purposefully slowing down the capabilities of their older phones in order to force their customers to buy a newer model. The fact that Apple is doing this is surprisingly not illegal. In fact they are getting sued, not for throttling the phones their customers purchased, but for doing it without notifying their customers. I think both should be illegal but the government seems to prefer to afford these companies greater freedoms at the cost of the public. I think a common argument to environmentalism and putting restrictions on companies is that this is going counter to the American ideal of freedom. However this freedom should be so strictly protected only for actual people, not overly powerful corporations. In fact by prioritizing corporations we are harming the public and limiting them in their pursuit of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

It's crazy to see how deeply entrenched consumerism is in American culture. I remember during the 2008 recession being told that the best way to jumpstart the economy again was to spend money, because the economy would remain stagnant if the money was not moved around. This made perfect sense to me, but I know realize the many problems that come with that mentality. "The Waste Makers" talking about how Eisenhower pushed the same idea makes me realize that the consumerism mentality was pushed onto us from the start. But how can I avoid buying into the system? (no pun intended)  "The Waste Makers" mentioned the fact that producers create fake competition by releasing multiple versions of the same product. I struggle enough as it is buying toothpaste because colgate has three shelves worth of products for all their different versions of toothpaste, but I can't go without brushing my teeth just to avoid this practice. The fact that they push consumerism over the wellbeing of the consumers, like Ken's cigarette example, is even more worrisome.

I found The Waste Makers eye-opening but this was  expected at this point in the course. Some phenomenons and daily ordeals can seem simple and normal but in reality we have been brainwashed into feeling as if we constantly need new products. Packyard describes how advertisers have been able to employ techniques that convince people that “there’s always room for more.” We often buy new items that we do not need or things that serve relatively low purposes in our lives. This ties into True Cost because we often obtain these products because of the feelings portrayed in advertisements. The film states, “The way to solve the problems in your life is thorough consumption.” Models, actresses, and actors appear to be happy and content in the advertisements, easily convinced their targeted audiences that they will essentially fill the voids in their life by purchasing their goods. When in reality, this creates a constant cycle of purchasing “wants” which are disguised as needs and then repeating once you are not actually fulfilled.
 <br><br>
Apple products present the perfect example of planned obsolescence. Apple constantly utilized the three steps into making its products obsolete and “needed” by consumers. The function, quality, and desirability of their products contribute to wheel people in. Apple constantly “upgrades” the previous features, systems, and technologies used in their iphones. Once the headphone jack was removed after the iphone 7, Apple then had the perfect opportunity to introduce a new set of headphones that will make the succeeding i-phones more efficient. Companies created “problems” with products and in turn create “solutions” with even more expensive products.

One thing that struck m the most while reading "The Waste Makers" was the part about automobile industries which are known to create cars that are supposed to withstand damage and keep the driver safe. Because of this desire to continue to make a profit and keep making "new" products or update that will cause people to buy the new product and get rid of the older one, the discussion of "maybe we can just add that improvement later, not now in order for us to make more profit." Everything revolves around making a profit. In terms of the amount of discard, there is a large number of cars that are thrown in junkyards, as well as people who don't throw out there car and just continue to keep the car around, either passing it on or just keeping it in the garage and not using it often. We truly have too many cars. 

 <br><br>

We are unfortunately in a capitalist society that relies on making money in order to succeed, and many of these corporations will do anything necessary to make the most money. Just like the iPhone, which each new update could last around 5-10 years before an update, Apple comes out with new updates almost every year and new software that starts to make the older version from 4 years ago, obsolete. Making people continue to buy the newest version for two reasons, to be the coolest person and keep up with the trend and to have a working phone. 

 <br><br>

Corporations have really become corrupt and are the primary reason for why there is so much waste on our planet, the supply chain has grown too much.

Hey, much like you I was struck with the idea that certain companies and corporations purposely malfunction their own products to make customers purchase upgrades years later. Recently, Apple is facing a multi-million dollar lawsuit for "secretly throttling" older iPhones. I personally have fell victim to this as I have bought 3 iPhones in 4 years. Looking at this from a corporate perspective, this is a genius marketing move to bring in insane revenue. However,  I wish more Americans were aware of this consumer scheme. 
 <br><br>

While reading this, I came to a realization about my current financial decisions. Unfortunately, I have been purchasing unnecessary things in order to fill a void. This quarter has been academically and socially poor thus I have been practicing consumerism culture. I will no longer be prone to bad shopping habits and instead try to live a life without too much stuff.


<br><hr>

Much like you, Apple's business model of constantly releasing updated products was going through my head as well while reading "The Waste Makers." Growing up, I'd be astonished at the amount of people who continued to by Iphones despite complaining about battery issues and cracked screens literally months later. I found it to be the same with vacuum cleaners as well as my mom would constantly be saying "they just don't build things to last anymore. For awhile I thought that this idea of products breaking relatively easily or fast was more of a 21st century practice.
 <br><br>

Reading "The Waste Makers" I was astonished to see that this and the idea of obsolescence had been an foundational aspect to American companies for almost a century now. Packard's analysis of how different facets of the American business were using the economy to justify their shaping of American consumerism drew me back to a point previously made by Ken in another lecture video relating these marketing techniques to propaganda. The way these business methodically work out how to, not only sell the product, but "sell gluttony" to me is not different than attempting to brainwash people into following a damaging ideology. How can it possibly be our fault for the way we are living our lives when this consumer greed is ingrained into the very way we live from the day we are born?

Hi, although I agree that capitalism has created the overproduction of items in the market, I do not think that you can place the blame on the corporations making the new and slightly improved products. After all, in order to survive the relentless competition in society, a business has to produce higher quality products at lower prices. Thus, it is the competition embedded within capitalism that allows more people to have access to things like stoves, iphones etc, which in turn raises people's standards of living. It is no coincidence that worldwide poverty is decreasing; it is in fact the forces of capitalism that have lifted many people out of poverty bringing them from rags to riches. So I don't believe it is correct to view capitalism as an evil economic system.
 <br><br>
Despite this, I do understand that the competition of capitalism has led to the environmental crisis we are facing. Regulations need to be put in place to steer us in the direction of sustainability.

I agree with you that businesses today are lost in profits, but one thing I have to mention is that the economy does rise with their greed. Let's still think about the car situation here. Cars made before 2000 fit with the standard you have described: "withstand damage and keep the driver safe." I have a friend who bought a car made in 1990; it's nice, drivable, and just like a modern car after he installed a radio system on it. Companies at that time did their best to make their cars perfect but the problem caused by that is cars became totally luxury things before 2000. Everyone can pretty much afford a car today but not before 2000. That happened because, in the time before 2000, car companies allocate their materials costs and labor costs to buyers all on one single purchase. After 2000, many companies discarded their loyalties and separate their cars into different levels; the cheaper the car is, the lower the quality is. This action sounds horrible, but it makes cars become affordable. And they do not allocate costs on a single purchase anymore but start doing upgrading and making money from that. It's the consumer's choice to do upgrading or not. No one should expect to buy the best thing at the cheapest prices; that never gonna happen. And many people think the upgradings offered by car makers are too expensive, so they start to look for private businesses that can do those cheaply. That creates many opportunities and workspace. To many of us, carmakers suck, but to many people who just want a car and to many semi-skilled workers who are not accepted by the carmakers, thank god they finally get what they want. 
 <br><br>
Wastes created are a huge problem. However, I do not think we should blame car companies for that. If consumers do not keep asking for advanced model and upgrading, there should not be that many old cars dumped.



<br><hr>
I have also recently learned through this weeks reading the corporate side of how to hook consumers in order to keep them coming back for more.  As an American, I cannot say that I am the exception and have not fallen victim to the schemes of Apple or Ford and have wanted to upgrade my technology in order to stay "hip".  They use brainwashing techniques and the tactic of "planned obsolesce" in order to ensure that people will keep coming back to buy their products.  After this weeks set of sources, I have taken a step back and looked at this issue from a broader standpoint and seen that so many industries across the board do this.  They use cheap labor to make their products so that they can sell it to unknowing Americans at a lower price while devastating the environment.  All the while, the only ones who are truly benefitting are the CEOs who are making more and more money at the expense of everyone and everything else.  They all use these strategies to keep a thumb on their own country and keeping other countries reliant on their business as well so that they can't lose.  The only way to defeat them is to educate yourself.  Become aware of the problem so that you can be a more conscious consumer and try things like slow fashion and slow food so that we as consumers take back control of what we are purchasing and stop wasting so many resources on things that we don't really need, we were just told that we need.

Hey! I totally agree about what you said. The Apple company is now really just trying to make money as much as possible. The new iPhone every year has no very big difference except for size and camera. The new functions on phones can be successfully installed by updates, but they just give you a new iPhone to buy. It is almost the same for iPads. On the contrary, for most of the android phones, if there are no big updates, they would not be giving new phones.
 <br><br>


The ideas sending out from the Waste Makers really warned me about whether keeping my old things such as clothes and other kinds of stuff. Looking back to my wardrobe, there are too many, too many clothes I bought. Although not as many as the average "68 clothes", but as a teenager, more than 20 clothes I had in my closet that I am not wearing anymore is not only shocking but also regretting. 

 <br><br>

I am really hoping to challenge the Minimalism, even if I could not really become one of them. I will start to cut the clothes I am going to buy and/or other everyday stuff. I am sure everyone can follow this path and give their strength to save the planet.



<br><hr>

I agree with what you said, especially the part about where you mentioned how corporations are willing to do anything. In Apple’s case, they even admitted to slowing down older phones so people would buy the latest one, and there’s a new one every year. Every September. All the wasted resources and plastic going into making these phones, and it’s just a cycle of tossing it out when you’re unsatisfied? It’s ugly. The only times I’ve replaced my phone was when it stopped working.
 <br><br>
One of my favorite quotes that stuck with me while reading “The Waste Makers” was when Vance Packard compared people to animals, saying how, “The people of the United States are in a sense becoming a nation on a tiger.” We’re just constantly taking in so much that nothing really satisfies us. To answer Ken’s question at the end of the video, I think it’s a two sided cause that started with corporations but works as a parasite with consumers to form this cycle of never ending consumption.



<br><hr>

While there is some debate on whether consumerism is driven by the consumers or the corporations that feed this, after reading this I truly believe it is the corporations that are driving this cycle. I agree with the point that you made that corporate greed and corruption is the problem here. They are too focused on making a quick profit that they don’t stop to think of the environmental impact they’re making or the mental health toll it has on people. Corporations really don’t care what becomes of the product after it’s sold, whether it’ll sit in a junkyard or go straight to the trash, as long as they’re making money, they’ll keep releasing “new and improved” products or products with a short lifetime.



<br><hr>
This stood out to me a lot as well. It's interesting how focused big corporations and our society is on constantly creating new, disposable products and promoting this idea of eternal economic growth that follows it. It makes me think of Bush's famous response to the terrorism that occurred during his term: "go out and shop." The propagation of this idea has gone so far within our culture; even to the extent that we don't even question when our phones break after only owning them for two years, or how our immediate response to disaster in our country is to go shopping. This never-ending consumption is an environmental disaster, yet we can't seem to stop, as it's so far engrained into our culture.

I had a similar feeling to yours after reading “The Waste Makers”. Nowadays, the industries, companies, and enterprises in every area whether IT or estate companies seem to regard their profits before any other aspect such as satisfaction and interest of their consumers. This idea kind of violates the original intention as an entrepreneur. Of course, a businessman wants to maximize its company’s profits every time. As a businessman, however, we should consider consumers’ interests as an essential piece as well during its operation. If a company lost a big part of its consumers due to some unexpected reasons, their consumers will likely choose to buy its substitutes or go to a similar restaurant. Although it is reasonable that companies should innovate and create some newer and better items, its premise should be trying to make fewer wastes. I like your example in your comment: “iPhone”. Apple has been continuously introducing new products throughout the years. This strategy attracts a lot of people to but the newest iPhone even though the older one is still usable. The newer features will motivate people to buy one. However, a person might waste his older telephone.

After reading and analyzing chapter 2 through 7 of Vance Packard's "The Waste Maker," the author does an elegant job of delving into the business methodology of commercialism and the vicious cycle of consumerism that plagues Americans. In particular, Packard’s explanation of “planned obsolescence” emphasizes the extent of greed that corporations have to warrant making their products purposely fail after a certain period of time. Additionally, it conveys how manipulative and immoral they are to abuse the American people. “Planned obsolescence” supports consumers negative, never-ending habits of buying a product again and again. Not only is that detrimental to the mental health of purchasers, it’s incredibly harmful to our planet's well-being and adds further pressure on the climate crisis.

I agree you that mass consumerism is hindering to the mental health of consumers. Giant corporations use advertisements to control the mind of the consumer which ultimately leads to mass consumerism. Planned obsolescence is totally not justified because of the ramifications it has on the American population. There are so many people today that have had their mental health damaged and their self-consciousness due to psychological attacks that companies take to make us spend more. The negative effects advertising has on the consumer's brain is not worth what they spend their money on. Corporations are only interested in making money and do not even care about the effects that their advertisements have on the consumer or the environment. The cycle of buying objects just to buy them is toxic to the environment and the mind of the consumer, leading to mindless consumers buying products that don't make them happy and is detrimental to the environment.

Usually I can’t seem to get through much of any reading without ending up asleep somehow, but while reading this section of the book “The Waste Makers” I was wide awake and disgusted yet not surprised of the ways manufactures trick the public into buying their merchandise. The mere fact that some men from a company would show up to people’s homes claiming to be part of the government or engineers who came to check up on their equipment, just to purposefully mess with a perfectly fine device so they could sell more of them. One, that frightens me that that would happen before and two, it makes the company itself look bad. Although not all companies would make their products obsolete on purpose, the majority of them did in order to make more sales. If the product was good enough for people’s standards and they could give it a quick “death date”, better off for them. An example of this would be the lamps that was brought up in the book, they reduced the lifetime of the bulb by increasing the intensity and therefore people had to buy bulbs more quickly if they wanted a stronger, more intense light. Same thing with cars, they pushed big cars down people’s throats, figuratively speaking of course, and once they saw sales and gas mileage were depleting, they moved onto small compact cars. From there the ideology of families having two of everything in household started and everyone went consumer crazy buying things they didn’t really need but it’s what everybody else is buying. Much like today in age…
 <br><br>

I think we the consumers and the companies both are responsible for the obsession with consumerism. Companies use all these clever tricks to get people to buy into the idea and crave more of whatever they are selling even though it’s likely the same gimmick just in a new color or with one added feature. The consumer likely falls for these tricks because it’s how we’ve grown up. Well since I was little I remember playing with plastic, flimsy toys that would break in minutes of using them and I would just throw it away and later buy a new one, it was just a cycle. Much like the example given in the book. To be fair though I think we are more to blame in a sense because we tend to do things due to societal pressure. If a majority of people are doing something, people tend to follow. Trends are what hit close to home because we don’t want to feel out of the loop, we just want to fit in.

I relate to this comment so hard because I also usually cannot get through reading without getting distracted periodically and becoming very bored. However, "The Wastemakers" actually caught my attention and made me so interested because it is just a huge part of our lives becoming revealed to be completely different than what we thought it was. We thought we were the ones making the choice to buy things and spend our money however we wanted. But, after reading this I learned the consumerism culture that we are all a part of is just a scheme created by big productions to keep people spending more money. I never considered the fact that we are raised to become these consume
 <br><br>
rs, by seeing our parents do it, but also the ads target at us on television, which they discuss in thus book. A concept that also interested was the obsolesce of quality, desirability, and function. I didn't know that these were actual concepts used by companies to create more money for them. When something stops working, I usually blame myself. However, now I know that the companies may have done that on purpose so I could keep returning as a consumer. These 60 pages were one of the best uses of my time that I could imagine. I now have so much more knowledge about this and know so much more about the consumerism culture we are immersed in.

I am surprised by the fact that when a lot of people are planning to save the world from the climate crisis, the consumers or the people in the earth have been used to the consumerism, to buy lots and lots of products that they don’t even need. However, for the economic perspective, if the market wants to thrive, they need to sell as many as possible, and this idea contradicts the idea of many environmental protectors. They need to make sure that the goods they sell cannot stand or use or years so that consumers will come often and purchasing again. The idea of making long-lasting clothes costs not only the money of material but also the buyers.

According to the types of obsolescence listed by Packard in the "The Waste Maker", I think the first type of obsolescence is more reasonable when planned. As science and technology become more advanced, some new functions will be invented. For instance, the invention of the combination of the camera with the phone, every photo we take is more coinvent with an autoprocessing system on smartphones. For the obsolescence of quality, we can donate or sell our stuff for people who need it instead of throw in the garbage can. In this way we can at least reduces the amount of waste. The obsolescence of desirability often occurs when a product is still useable without any damage. However, the trends or fashion push someone to abundant it. As a consumer, we should be aware of such manipulation through advertising. 
 <br><br>

Both consumers and companies are responsible for this obsession with consumer stuff that is devastating to our planet because the American consumerism already becomes a kind of vicious circle between buying and selling stuff. If we want to mitigate the waste from mass consumption, one side must act first. If the consumer can pause and really think about their consumption and making choices thoughtfully, the companies would also see this declining trend on their new product, therefore, produce less. If fast fashion companies happen to realize their unethical behavior, which is quite difficult for someone who only cares about money, they may stop advertising.

I completely agree that we, as consumers, need to be intentional and aware of manipulation through advertising. I guess I always knew in the back of my mind that advertising was somewhat manipulative, but I didn’t realize the extent to which it was planned. It’s amazing how companies make products and “plan” obsolescence by making us want to own multiple of their product, want a new version of the item in the near future, or intentionally make their product not long lasting so we are forced to buy another one. If consumers are aware of the first two types, we can somewhat avoid being manipulated, but it’s much harder to avoid the third. After all, if the item wears out and isn’t able to be easily repaired, what can we do except buy another one? The consumer doesn’t benefit and neither does the Earth - and we need to somehow change that. 
 <br><br>
It was also appalling to me how advertising targets young children - arguably the most vulnerable group. It’s almost unethical to manipulate children’s brains when they don’t know any better and can’t defend themselves against it. How are people willing to encourage children to buy cigarettes which are unquestionably detrimental to their heath just for money? Because of this, I think that consumerism is a problem that needs to be addressed on the marketing level as well. Even if adult consumers can try to avoid being manipulated by being aware, children can’t. At what point will these companies prioritize the well being of people and the earth above financial growth? After all, financial growth won’t mean anything if our Earth is uninhabitable

I personally really enjoyed reading “The Waste Makers” because of how informative it was. The few chapters that we read talked about and really shed a light on the business mechanisms behind consumerism. In the beginning of the reading I was shocked to see that consumption must rise. At first I thought this was absolutely ridiculous because obviously consumption is terrible for the environment, but it made more sense after hearing the reasoning behind it. The average citizen is expected to step up their buying to nearly 50 percent in the next dozen years or the economy will fail. This is what is ultimately killing our planet. Marketing experts continue to put out new/unnecessary items all the time so people  can continue to consume. These experts have three tactics that they use if their products are already owned by families which persuades these families to continue buying. They can either sell replacements of an item, sell more than one item to each family, or dream up a new/improved product. Due to this, consumerism is all we know and this needs to change quickly. Consumerism has ramped up in the past 70 years and is going to continue growing if we don’t put an end to it. Americans have this idea in their head that they have to consume something new and then dispose of it quickly so they can buy the next new thing. It also does not help Americans that items are being produced much more than needed. Companies are selling these items even though they’re not that different from previous year’s versions. While consumerism/consumption is an individuals fault, I think it is ultimately companies of products that are to blame. These companies are doing crazy things to make profit and know how to market to an average citizen. The example that shocked me was the tobacco example. In 1987 the RJ Reynolds company promoted their cigarettes with a cartoon camel which ultimately appealed to children. These children were able to identify the camel that promoted smoking cigarettes just as easily as they could identify Mickey Mouse. This promoted children to start smoking at younger ages and thus put their own lives in jeopardy. With this being said, it is clear that companies are willing to go as far as promoting an item that can kill someone. It really shocks me that this is the case and makes me really sad. The fact that we have to live in a world that is so caught up with making profit instead of caring for the health/well being of others if ridiculous and needs to change.

If I were to describe this reading to anyone, it would be a statistical, informative approach to Walden. Whereas Walden focused on a general ecological sustainability, this book presented us with the viewpoint of an economist. It presented us with hard numbers which not only spell an ecological catastrophe, but an unavoidable market crash due to overproduction. It shocked me to read that market growth, which was once good, is now needed for our economy's survival. This alone should have been worrying to most Americans. More so, what really put things into perspective for me was the when he said that Americans were being asked to boost the economy in a year the same amount it had in the past 200. 
 <br><br>


This book also got me to reflect on our standards of living. If we are so much more efficient at producing goods, and have so much extra stock, why do we still have relatively the same standard of living? We still work 40 hours per week, we constantly fail to rank among the happiest countries (which should be easy since we are the richest country) and according to psychologists, average stress levels among the general population are at an all time high. It is time to reign in on corporate interests and profits in order to use this additional productivity for the general good. Lowering output would have all the ecological and economic benefits implied in the book, but additionally it would lead to additional quality of life benefits such as 4 day work weeks with the same salary.
 <br><br>


We often think of a utopian future where we don't have to work because robots do everything, but in our current economic model that is simply not possible because there would be no structure on how to pay people. With self driving cars and factory automation, we are actually closer to this than what most may realize. We simply have to let our economy adapt and change the way we pay people. The model where everyone works as much as possible is dated and no longer needed. We need to adapt to a future where people will get payed the same for doing less. For the first time in human history, we have to do less for our own good.

I was also very surprised to see that our consumption must rise or our economy will fail. The average american is supposed to step up their buying by 50% in the next dozen years or the economy will fail. Because we are trying to save our economy, this is resulting in the destruction of our environment. Evidently, the government prioritizes the economy over any environmental issues.We need to make a decision because if we continue to consume at the rates we currently are, the climate crisis will get much worse. Americans are much more care free and dispose of things that can easily be reused.Americans are always wanting the newest thing ti be in style because of the materialism in the United States.I also agree with you that corporations are to blame. It is appalling to see that cigarette companies appealed to children and ultimately led to an increase in children smoking. Were they targeting this audience? We dont know but Americans need to come to a realization that we must worry about our environment and health or our Earth will fall apart. We need to spread awareness and make a change.

As an aspiring copywriter, the fact that my practice lead to consumerism alarmed me. For the past year I’ve been looking into ways to jumpstart my career, but this video and the previous lectures have provided hesitation for me knowing that I’m effectively killing the planet by pushing people to buy into products. Although I believe that our desires will still be a higher priority than any effort to save the environment, I feel like we should be making a better effort to lower our rates of consumerism. As a whole, it renders us useless in terms of rising in the economy, but it is true that corporations make it seem necessary to follow their propaganda and spend money on their products.

After reading chapters 6 and 7 in Vance Packard’s book, The Waste Makers, I wasn’t as surprised or disgusted as I thought I would’ve been. The past few weeks of this class has made it clear that some people just don’t care about the environment or other people. It became evident in the lectures about how the older generations knew about climate change but did nothing to put a stop to it or when we discovered that fossil fuel companies will say and do anything to continue to make a profit. The fact that corporations made their products with a “death date” goes to show how we value wealth and a sale over integrity. I had heard about this process before, for example people have said that apple iphones seem to give out after a few years with things like the battery dies extremely quick, or the screen stops reacting to touch. Although this technique is completely wrong it doesn’t surprise me that it’s happened in our past and still might be happening today. I’m also not surprised that people were/are convinced that the objects they own become “old-fashioned” when the new thing comes out. It’s a really strategic sales method. I mean I participate in this little game every day. Let’s say I get a new iphone for my birthday and next month a new one comes out… well I might feel bad owning an outdated model. But the problem with all this is that we are wasting earth’s raw materials at an unprecedented rate and we need to find a way to cut back our consuming habits because we cannot sustain these lavish lifestyles that most Americans are used to.

I really relate to this comment because I find myself being less shocked of people's actions week by week. For example when I watched the first movie for the quarter, I was so surprised that companies that depend on fossil fuels such as Shell would go to great lengths to deny climate change to make sure that they keep making money. Or when politicians who were funded by these companies also deny it so that they can secure their position. After every article I read or movie I watch, peoples selfish and money conscience actions surprise me less and less and I have come to expect it. The corporations know exactly what they're doing with making cheap unreliable products that they know their consumers will have to throw away and buy another again soon. Nobody cares about the waste or environment problems they really just care about themselves and I don't even think we can partly blame consumers because we are conditioned from a young age to purchase cheap and throw away soon to make room for something else that is cheaper. Apple is a perfect example of a company basically forcing us to throw away and buy new. They even released an article stating that their updates made phones start to break down and become almost unusable leading the consumer to become frustrated and buying a new iphone. It is a terrible cycle that seems almost impossible to break because the only side that isn't benefitting from this exchange is the climate and no one seems to care about that.

I found this reading to be interesting because it shows the root of our issues as a society in regards to making waste and our excessive consumerism that is prevalent in every purchase we make. I remember learning in history class in high school about the boost in purchasing in America and the rise in popularity of suburban areas. This change, in the 50s and 60s, led to consumerism increasing heavily, as well as the rise in products being sold intended to become obsolete. As the idea of the all-American family became more popular, people also began to desire the newest products and appliances, trying to compete with their neighbors and show that they were the most successful through owning the newest stuff. Although this was decades ago, this concept is still common today, and many people have an obsession with owning the newest version of everything they buy, only for it to become obsolete and become waste. One of the most prevalent examples that comes to mind is Apple products. Most people I know have iPhones, and get a new one every 2 or 3 years. With every new release, Apple adds another component, which is presented as a must-have improvement to essentially the same product. With the technology we have available, it is obvious that we shouldn’t have to replace our smartphones this often, yet it has become the norm. Most people wouldn’t give second thought to repurchasing items, even though every item we throw away is only contributing to the waste on our planet. This idea, to me, is one of the most discouraging aspects of the climate crisis because I don’t see this being able to change in recent years due to our obsession with owning things. Going back to last week’s lecture and film, we are an extremely materialistic society and place much of our value on how much we possess. However, this lifestyle obviously leads to waste, as people throw away what has fallen out of the current trends or what has become obsolete. This reading and the corresponding lectures definitely made me think twice about why I see value in owning the newest design, and how I can decrease my own waste.

The consumer society advocates that the more you consume, the happier you will be. The line of consumerism that declines without consumption. As a result, a large amount of resources are consumed and waste is being discharged. It has brought serious resource crisis and environmental pollution crisis to human beings. However, due to the prevalence of consumerism, it has objectively stimulated economic development. Promoted social progress. The negative effects of resources and environment brought by it have not received widespread attention from the global community. The capitalist countries that entered the consumer society earlier are developing deeper into the consumer society. The concept of consumerism is also in Eastern and Central Europe. Developing countries such as India and China have been rapidly spread and carried forward. The prevalence of the consumer society has brought economic prosperity and social progress. However, it also inevitably brings a large amount of consumption of resources and a large amount of waste emissions. Triggered a serious resource crisis and the environment. This will definitely affect the implementation of the global sustainable development strategy. And the process of modernization in developing countries. This is an issue that deserves our high attention.

This week the main theme of the reading material is to criticize the current consumerism. As in the era of fast-fashion, people’s consumption habits have changed dramatically from that of in previous times. We can see that consumption is a big part of the American economy, if people stop consuming, the whole economy would face a large problem. Therefore, in order to prevent the great promotion of the national economy from slowing down, the businessman began to make changes in the products we buy and advertisement we see in everyday life. There is an idea now “there is always room for more products in the home.” Advertisement began to make people have more houses, so people need to buy more things to put in the house, and definitely cars to go between each house. Also, factories now make things for a short life-span intentionally in order to stimulate more consumption. In previous decades, the durability of an item is the most important feature, but in the current economy, the advertisement will tell you that you need to buy new items to meet the needs of the time. We can see now that the “Buy-more and Throw-away” idea became more and more popular now. People buy new things not only because new stuff can function better, but more importantly because consumers desire to simply buy more. And things that still work well will be thrown away simply because they cannot “meet the needs of time.” It’s not fair and destructive. The true cost behind cannot be measured solely by money. Tons of natural resources and human capital are suffered in this era. They are wasted and suffered just because rich people need to keep their economy prosperous. It makes no sense. We cannot accept the idea that everything is disposable. Unfortunately, very few of us have realized the bloody facts that this is not a sustainable way of life. The author urgently called for attention. And the reading is extremely emotionally impactful. I hope everyone could realize the fact, and make changes in every single one of ourselves.

While I was reading chapters 2-7 of "The Waste Makers," I wasn't surprised with how President Eisenhower was reacting after the recession. Although the increase is consumer goods during this time lowered unemployment rates drastically, this caused people to spend large amounts of cash on materialistic items, which in turn lead to more CO2 emissions from manufacturers. Something that caught my attention was the amount of money the average American spends on JUST a product's label every year. How much money is put into creating an item vs how much companies end up reselling it for is crazy. Big brand companies are profiting off of people who don't mind spending $300 on a shirt that probably only took $10 (or less) to be made by someone else. 
 <br><br>
I can admit that I myself have been one of those people that wanted the next, best version of something once it was announced. This is is where examples of the obsolescence of desirability comes in. After seeing multiple films for this class and after doing the weekly readings, I can see I've been more and more careful on what I choose to spend my money on. So far, I have seen myself saving a little more money each week. People believe that flaunting their money with high end items and clothing proves their economic status and wealth to others is the way to go. I just think it's dumb how money and your visual appearance basically defines someone's initial assumptions about you.

You bring up an interesting point about profit driven product manufacturing. I discussed this idea with a coworker of mine the other day. Working in retail for a jewelry company, we see how much something costs to make, how much we buy it from the said company, and finally how much the store organization we work for sells it. Seeing these numbers next to each other is quite astonishing, as it is not uncommon for an $100 piece of jewelry to cost $4 to produce. My coworker and I decided that the retail business, and profits in the retail industry in general, is the result of basically one idea: exploitation. Although you did not use this exact rhetoric, you mention this idea and it is extremely real and prevalent. It seems that America's hunger to consume is dependent on exploiting workers, less developed nations, and the consumers who get addicted to these products.

By reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I came to realize how wasteful we are as a society.  I always viewed the idea of shopping as something that is quite normal and harmless in our society.  Packard has opened my eyes to the way people so easily dispose of things after they feel it is no longer the latest version of its kind.  Packard outlines the way companies get people to purchase their products through obsolescence.  The desire to continuously purchase new or excess items is obtained through the advertisements of companies.  Our society has normalized and rationalized our need to, "Buy and be happy."  We have normalized the way consumers purchase mass amounts of products without taking a step back to account for the effects we have left on our planet.  Overconsumption increasingly continues to pollute our atmosphere and it is both the fault of the consumer and company.  We need to realize the negative effects that come with rapid consumption and disposal.

Obsolescence, a business strategy emphasized in Packard’s book, is defined as “the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order.” As outlined in his text, although products can be maintained to last long periods of time, corporations have convinced their consumers that they need the newest edition of what they are selling. This ideology is devastating as consumers are compelled to buy a surplus of items that they do not need. Like Carmen has explained, when we buy, we believe we become happier. This correlation is not true, as people are stuck in the cycle of consumerism, continuously buying unnecessarily in order to fill a void. I agree that it has been normalized in American society, and has excelled significantly since Packard published his book in the 1960s. Like we have seen in the documentary, “The True Cost” fashion industries now release “seasonal” clothing lines 52 times a year, producing new styles by the week. This causes trends to come in out of style at rapid speed and creates a society of waste makers as people are compelled to buy products for their “newness” and “fashion” rather than their usefulness. I stand with Carmen that is up to consumers to realize how they have been brainwashed to conform to this cycle as it has been normalized in Western society since the 1950s.

If I had never taken this class, thus never reading "The Waste Makers", I too would have never really come to realize how wasteful we are as a society. After reading about the way how corporations advertise and convince us to buy their new products, I am ashamed to admit that I am one of the people that the corporations have successfully brainwashed. My iPhone 10 was completely in working order, yet when the iPhone 11 was released, I immediately swapped my iPhone 10 for the 11. I did not realize that by doing this, I was feeding into the consumer mindset that is damaging our environment. Now that I know better however, I will do my best to stop feeding into this destructive mindset, and also start to spread this awareness to my friends and family.

The book “The Waste Makers” shows me the situation of fierce consumerism in 1960s. Vance Packard utilizes his temporal angle to explain how great consumption have been inspired by bulging inventories of goods. One factor is the ever-growing efficiency of the U.S. productive force since mid 20th century, and the other factor is the great expansion of U.S. various industries based on persuasion towards public to consume more. Marketing experts, advertising men, and even the president are continually spread the idea that consumption brings happiness, status, freedom, and enjoyment as well as it is significant for national economy. All kinds of industries only focus on selling points, making superficial changes in order to promote sales. People face consumerism doctrine about everything they use: carpets, deodorants, stockings, nail enamel, swimming suits, eyeglasses, rings, etc. In addition to these fashionable stuffs, cars industries flaunt themselves to be appropriate for modern living, changing into the form of greater bulk, greater power, more accessories, and more chrome. These truths make me absolutely agree with Ken’s discourse that these corporations chose their needs over consumers. 
 <br><br>

There are three kinds of ridiculous and ironic “Planned Obsolescence”, according to Vance Packard. First, the Obsolescence of function shows that many seemingly new and creative functions of products are provided as selling points rather than true research outcomes, indicating the overtones of manipulation. Second, the Obsolescence of quality is really satiric because it trends away from durability and trends toward shoddiness, aiming to promote the sale of replacement even without morality. Third, the Obsolescence of desirability is greatly related to people’s psychology, especially in apparel fields. By changing the color, degree of ornamentation, and profile, the producer hoaxes consumers to follow fashion trending and make themselves look successful and gorgeous. Overall, I believe that these cultural practices need to be changed if we want to mitigate the climate crisis, for these processes of production, consumption, and discard have so fundamental influence on the environment.

Regarding your comment on the three kinds of “Planned Obsolescence” that Packard discussed, I completely agree that they are having a detrimental effect on the environment. Pretty much every company I encounter uses these tactics to sell as much as they can to maximize profit. I see the obsolescence of quality used quite prevalently in the clothing industry. Fast fashion companies such as Forever 21 make incredibly cheap clothes that have terrible quality. I’ve bought dresses from such companies that have fallen apart after just a few uses. These companies do this intentionally to make sure that customers have to keep coming back to buy more clothing. I find it appalling. I’m sure at someone involved in the production of this clothing is aware of the detrimental impact everything that goes into making and shipping clothes has on the environment, yet they don’t do anything about it because of the monetary incentive. 
 <br><br>

I also agree with you statement that these practices have to be changed in order to fight climate change. The problem, however, is how. As we can see from Vance Packard’s book, these practices have been going on in our country since the 1960’s. Of course we see individuals, like the makers of the Minimalism documentary for instance, pushing back against rampant consumerism. Overall, though, our country is still highly dependent on these capitalistic ideals. The problem is in the corporations and the marketers that push the country to depend on consumerism. The greatest hope I see in taking down big corporations like this is in both voting and refusing to support these companies as much as possible.

It is fascinating to see how modern Vance Packard's "Waste Makers" is today. It is true that we live in an economy that thrives on unsustainable consumable goods. As a society, we have become accustomed to the death date of products as being a standard of consumerism. Now that the country has been following this method of production for over 70 years it will be a hard transition for both the economy and companies to adjust to a new standard of production. I believe it is a necessary change in aims of preserving the state of our environment. However, my only question is how are we to make this change? I understand how the course recently has been directing us towards a state of "minimalism" to ensure that we only have things that are necessary or add value to our lives. It is entirely plausible that our class will adopt methods of sustainability and shift towards a brighter future for consumerism and the environment. But, will this radical change throw our economy into a recession if we all stop buying products? I think it may have a disastrous effect on the welfare and employment of millions if companies need to start downsizing to reach standards that adhere to our society's goals. I'm not saying it is wrong, but a lot of people will be forced to look for other means of income if this standard is adopted on a global scale.
 <br><br>


So how can we mitigate disastrous results while also protecting the environment?

Chapters 2-7 of the “Waste Makers” were extremely enlightening.  I enjoyed this reading because it taught me how easily manipulated I am. In the chapter, “There’s always room for more”, I was convinced I am the easiest person to sell things to. I mean if you look at every product in your house and ask yourself what number of product that is, it becomes crazy. I am an18 year old who has already gone through 8 phones, 3 laptops, 4 fridges, three sets of washers/dryers, 9 tv sets, and 7 cars. This is crazy when you consider that (hopefully) I have only lived for around a quarter of my life. If every person is similar to me, we are consuming way too many products. In this same chapter I found it interesting when we read about the different trends in companies such as the wedding ring manipulation. We have all been brainwashed into thinking we need more of everything. This all ties into the obsolescence rules discussed in the Progress Through Planned Obsolescence chapter. Obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, obsolescence of desirability, are all methods used to scheme us into buying new products. What most frustrates me is that Apple ruins our old products so we are forced to buy the new.
 <br><br>

When you consider how many products all of us go through at a time, it is incredibly shocking that our companies are producing more than that. That the production is outweighing the consumers? How can that be when we shop more than we ever have before? Our automobile companies could produce 8 million cars this year but we won’t all buy them. I guess this all relates to my comment from a few weeks ago. I knew consumption was bad for my wallet, but I had no idea it was this bad for the planet. It is actually insane.

I too was taken back when I actually thought about how big the American "supply and demand" system is. We all learned about it in our economics classes in high school and it is a simple idea that makes sense. But when you actually think about all the things we purchase and how the companies who manufacture them have to create millions of the same item just in case every single person on this planet wants it too, that is so much stuff being produced for no reason at all. The first thing I thought about when I was reflecting on the supply and demand system, I instantly thought about Target's dollar section. Every single time I walk in to Target I immediately head to that section and end up buying at least 3 things that I definitely do not need but I think they are cute and make an excuse that I will find a use of it just because it so cheap and I want it in the moment. Many of those things end up being thrown or given away to others in the next three months. Americans, including myself, purchase things that we do not need and in an excessive amount. We all really need to begin thinking about if we really need to purchase stuff and if we all were to do that, it would mean that supply would not be as heavily produced and would help reduce our waste.


<br><hr>
I was similarly shocked while reading “The Waste Makers” to learn about marketing’s effect on me. I always feel in control when I’m buying new things, as if I decided that I needed the new iPhone or makeup product… but that’s exactly how I’m meant to feel; in actuality, I was carefully convinced that I should buy those things, sometimes without even realizing I was being advertised to. The planned obsolescence chapter really frustrated me. In this class we are learning that in order to save ourselves and the environment from disaster, we must reduce our resource use, but the concept of planned obsolescence is the exact opposite of this! As Packard outlines, products become obsolete in a few different ways, but they all involve the production and consumption of brand new products that we shouldn’t need, and the whole process is planned so that more product can be sold. 
 <br><br>
I’ve begun shopping vintage for multiple reasons, but I mention it because one of my motivations for doing so is relevant to this idea: over the last few years I’ve become increasingly more frustrated watching my brand new clothes disintegrate in just a year or two, or even a few months… they seemed to fall apart quicker and quicker as time goes on. I know that the idea of fast fashion and planned obsolescence in clothes isn’t new, but by buying vintage, I usually end up with higher-quality pieces that could last me a lifetime. I feel like I’ve finally freed myself from the cycle of buying more and more clothing that will only fall apart… exactly as the manufacturer intended. This manipulation of consumers is frustrating, but by not relying on the fast fashion industry anymore, I feel like I’m rebelling against the system in a small way.

My response in this class to much of the "quit consuming" talk of this class has been that consuming is an essential part to our economy. Much of what I learned in high school was along these lines. Consumer culture, while wasteful at times, is the reason our economy is booming the way that it is. My high school economics teacher said that the way to get out of a recession is to BUY, because the more you buy, the more money is available in the economy. 
 <br><br>


However, after reading Waste makers, I see that a lot of it is really unnecessary. We could have a good economy, even if people weren't buying meaningless goods. The fact that companies are pushing goods that are planned to become obsolete is not a surprise but it is so horrible for the environment. The three different types of obsolescence outlined by Packard are so prominent in this day and age, and when I look around I see that almost all of my possessions have a type of obsolescence planned out in them. 
 <br><br>


The thing I also have realized is that our economy will become 10x worse if the climate crisis continues than it would be if people just started consuming sustainably. The problem is that it will be up to the companies, not the consumers for more sustainable and long-lasting, quality-based products to be produced. 
 <br><br>

Also, I was very interested in the "throwaway spirit." The fact that many people just throw away items when they are moving instead of auctioning them off shows how much value diminishes as soon as it is owned. We see this with cars too. As soon as you drive a new car off the dealership lot, its price goes down by thousands. This is absurd for a car that is literally new. I see people like my grandparents who will work very hard to fix things that break, and then I see a lot of people my age who would rather buy a new item than learn how to fix it.
 <br><br>


This reading has convinced me that the consumer culture, while beneficial for the economy, is much worse for the environment, and we have to get off the path that we are on in order to reduce our carbon footprints.

Our environment is suffering at the expense of our economy. I agree that our generation has a problem with buying new things over and over as opposed to fixing the things that they already have. I also think that we have a societal problem where we change the standards of what's "cool" and that prompts us to buy the latest things in order to be seen as important by our neighbors. As the book said, it's not the quality of the car, its how many cars you have. It's more important for people to be able to show that they have a ton of things than to buy one nice thing. 
 <br><br>

I agree with you about the meaningless goods, but I think that the consumers have a part to play when it comes to purchasing sustainable products and repairing them so that they consume less. I think that we don't need the newest thing all the time. The whole chapter in the book where they talked about lawnmowers and having to have the newest automatics ones that you ride is an example of things that aren't even better quality in the end and probably just cost more. We live in a money-oriented society and companies will do everything in their power to make money. We live in a society where many people are struggling financially and the first thing on their mind isn't saving the environment, it's buying something cheap and meeting society's standards of "cool" in one way or another. If that means having 3 junky cars as opposed to 1, then they will. Or if that means contributing to fast fashion they might as well. I think the first problem that we should be attacking is the societal problem where everyone cares too much about what others think.

After reading the assigned chapters of "The Waste Makers," I feel upset at so, many including myself, for feeling powerless against American consumerism. I also partially can’t blame us for not realizing how companies increase their profit with numerous techniques ranging from psychological to packaging. This has not only shown me how we have become so blinded to the consumer culture, not just buying things we truly don’t need but wasting so many of our possessions or not using them to their full extent. Again, many companies are important in encouraging this wasteful behavior, as so many of the things that are sold in a temporary fashion so that they can sell more and more in the future. Like Ken said before, it isn’t that we need these companies to be constantly supplying us with items, the companies need us to constantly be pumping out products. It is our responsibility, with our earth’s health in mind, to be mindful of companies’ tactics and really just looking at our lifestyles and reflecting on what we are buying and WHY we are buying it. Packard did an excellent job in dissecting the way these societal constructs have spun out into becoming a major contributor to the climate crisis. Overproduction is something we have allowed to continue on for so long, partially because we are not aware and partially because we do not care enough to change our ways to discourage it.

I agree with what you say about being "blinded to the consumer culture." In "The Waste Makers," published in the year 1960, Vance Packard addresses consumerism in America, including the ways in which companies have managed to make more products and increase production by creating obsolete products and new versions. Today like in the past decades, we are part of the blind consumer culture in which companies put time spans on items, to reduce the quality of an item. This is one way in which people continue to buy stuff, due to the quality of an item that eventually needs to be replaced or repaired. Another way that we are pulled to consume is by being told that a new shirt or electronic device will bring us fulfillment. When this was published in the 21st century we see the roots of a culture of consumerism based on the quality of products and wastefulness.
 <br><br>
Today, we see how the impacts of waste and what we buy contribute to the climate crisis. In reading "The Waste Makers," I think about how "The Waste Makers" reflects today's consumer culture, a culture that wants to own more and be economically fit based on our possessions. Moreover, I also agree with what you said about the responsibility of caring for our earth. In order to do so, we need to hold accountable the waste we are creating, while only purchasing what we need in life. It is up to us to decide the future of our consumer culture, and find ways to preserve the planet by being less wasteful and more considerate.

I definitely agree with you that a lot of Americans fall into the traps set out by companies to get us to buy their products. It's really disheartening that people are so selfish and greedy that they would completely disregard our planet in order to make profit.




<br><hr>

I 100% agree with your response. Companies only supply what is demanded and fast fashion and new items every week is a part of that demand. We are so completely blinded by what is actually happening that the environmental consequences aren't anywhere near the unrealistic picture. We no longer cherish or value what we buy and it has resulted in us periodically buying and throwing out dangerous products wherever we want to. The production and waste of these plastics or clothing is severely hurting not only our planet but also our people. I agree it is our fault because we have let this catastrophe go on for much too long without thinking about life-long consequences. Our people need to become more aware about these company's tactics to fast forward this process and think about the necessities instead of the unnecessary wants.



<br><hr>

The overproduction is the part I make resonate with. Although people might think it is hopeless to put actions forward to consumerism, I think customers' actions need to first be changed for the producers' behaviors. If customers simplify their lifestyles or purchasing behaviors, it will become much more easy to live a life. More importantly, the companies and manufacturers then do not have to produce an excessive amount of clothing, cars, computers, etc. This is a system, or cycle, that we should stop making it happen again and again. Hopefully, we can minimize our desire to make the world a better place.

“But how much should we rejoice when General Electric introduces a toaster with nine buttons, which make it possible to obtain a piece of toast in any of nine shades?”

 <br><br>

This quote from the reading “The Waste Makers” really stood out to me as it exemplified how unnecessary the “upgrades” we insist on having on our appliances or electronics truly are. No one needs 9 shades of toast, at the most people like things to the maximum light brown, and if they want it more toasted (for some reason) they could just put it in the toaster again. To throw out a perfectly good toaster that can do the same thing as a standard toaster is just stupid. With this, I was assured I have too many things I don’t actually need or use that often even though in the moment I bought them thinking they would make my life easier or better. 
 <br><br>
The quote from Advertising Age, “creating desire for goods gets harder” mentioned by Packard exemplifies how we actually do not need the things that are marketed to us: if we needed it, it would not be difficult to get people to want the products designed by these companies. So, what could make people want things? What drives people to buy things to enhance their lives or themselves? Insecurity and expectations. This reading made me understand the power of triggering our insecurities that we didn’t even know we were supposed to have. I have no idea where I read this article, but I remember reading something about how it was not normalized for women to shave their legs/armpits/bikini line or really anything until the early 20th century as they dressed more modestly, and shaving was associated with masculinity. When razor companies wanted to expand their markets, they used rationing from the war(s) as an excuse to start advertising to women after cloth, such as nylon, was used for military products. Women could then not get ahold of stockings that would conceal their leg hair as easily, this allowed razor companies to toy with the insecurity of hair on women’s bodies, as if it was “weird.” Without this circumstance, it would have been hard for companies to be able to make shaving appealing to women, as there would be no reason for them to feel bad about themselves.

 <br><br>

I remember being in middle school and falling for advertisements all the time. I felt like if I didn’t have the newest whatever I was not living the life I was supposed to be living, or it would fulfill some sort of step in becoming who I was meant to be whether it be clothes, certain “cool kid” foods, shoes, you name it. What this really reminded me of was Apple. People have probably already mentioned this, but every time a new phone comes out everyone rushes to upgrade their phones. Especially this time around, with the iPhone 11 which has like 3 camera lenses for some reason??????? However, every time I get a new phone I swear on my life since the iPhone 7 came out the quality has been about the same. I am no expert on camera quality but with my untrained eye I genuinely don’t think there was a difference in the quality between my 7 and my X. These little tweaks that they assure will completely change the game on the way we use our iPhones have always bothered me, for me, the quality never changes anything for me. I understand that we live in a capitalistic economy, and that making money is important blah blah blah whatever, but it is extremely frustrating to see how gullible we all are. Imagine all the money and materials we could save if we did not obsess over the new “whatevers” and just used the things that already work for us. 
 <br><br>
As I have gotten older, I have cut down on so much, mainly because I can’t afford it, but honestly, my life is just the same without these things that I thought before would fulfill me, and the insecurities that I had before I bought whatever product I still have, and honestly may have worsened. We have so much at stake in the climate that we are in right now, how many settings on our toasters we have can wait.

I truly believe that smartphones are the new version of the “9 setting toaster” discussed in this week's reading. We routinely look for a reason to buy new smartphones, whether it be a slightly better battery or camera, even though our current device operates perfectly. I recently got a new iPhone 11 and was so excited about it since I was upgrading from an iPhone 7. I was massively underwhelmed by the improved features and it really operates the same as my old phone other than a slightly better camera. 
 <br><br>


As the reading points out, my case with the iPhone is not uncommon though. We are constantly led to believe that what we have isn't enough and that the newest product is the next big thing, while in reality, it is the same product with minor modifications. I also have done my best to cut my consumerism, and not having money has certainly helped, but I plan on taking these habits with me for the rest of my life.


<br><hr>

I agree. I think one point you made that really stuck out to me was that if we actually needed the product, companies wouldn't work so hard to get people to want the product. I think that's where a lot of the issue lies- companies produce things they very well know we don't need or really want, so they work hard through targeted marketing, making new things feel trendy, or making older items seem outdated, to make us feel guilty about/embarrassed of  the items we do have in hopes we'll replace them with their product. They make the whole situation, as you said, very middle school. They add new features, shinier buttons, bigger cameras, more colors, matching pairs for couples, etc, that most of the time don't even make a difference on the quality of the features of the product- they usually work just the same, they just cost more. Anything to get you to want it, to make you feel like you fit in/are one of the "cool" people. In most cases, it works and we do cave and buy the newer product, even if we don't need it. From this article I really realized that consumerism/the commercial industry is really just glorified peer pressure- they don't really care about how you feel they just want you to do what they want- if you cave and do what they want you feel good for a little bit, then eventually feel guilty or regret the decision. But if you ignore them, you're honestly doing better for yourself and, in this case, for the planet as well.

When I read the part about the toaster producing shades of toast, I laughed to myself. Mainly because of how true it is. I too, when I was younger, was a victim of falling for ads and consuming things just because the people in the ad looked happy and their life looked put together. My whole life I thought I was consuming things for my needs and personal wants, but looking back- I realize how brainwashed I was. It is sad to see ads to this day participating in such toxic messages. For example, I saw an ad with girls aged 5-7 years of age and they were putting on makeup! The overall message was that they felt prettier and happier after buying and using the makeup. Now that I realize how toxic the ads are with our culture of consumption, I look back on this ad with disgust. No longer are little kids left to their own opinions: Kids as young as 5 years old are being told what to buy and how to become happy...




<br><hr>
When reading the quote from the text and this comment, I immediately thought of Apple's iPhone cycle and development as well. As I thought to myself, "Why in the world would anyone want or need 9 different shades of toast?", I also thought about why I so desperately need the upgraded retina display, improved camera with portrait mode, and a screen that's an eighth of an inch bigger than the one I have now. I couldn't agree more that insecurities and expectations are the driving forces that push people to upgrade from the device, electronic, or appliance that they already have, which in most cases works exceptionally well without any fault or inconveniences. 
  <br><br>

While I would argue that Apple's iPhone, along with many other companies with similar technologies and focus [consumer electronics] , I would say that my most recent example/perspective of "Planned Obsolescence" involves DJ equipment and mixers. For many who are interested in music and DJing, there is a common understanding that Pioneer DJ is the leading and dominant company in the industry, mirroring Apple in many different ways, especially planned obsolescence. Very often, Pioneer’s “upgraded” products introduce maybe 2-3 new features that justify raising the price hundreds of dollars compared to the original version of the product. Yet, everyone continues to buy. That everyone includes myself, as I am one of the people who was captivated enough by those 2-3 new features, upgrades, and even color, to spend the extra hundred dollars instead of buying the cheaper, equally efficient original and older version. 
  <br><br>

“We make good products, we induce people to buy them, and then next year we deliberately introduce something that will make those products old fashioned, out of date, obsolete... It isn't organized waste. It's a sound contribution to the American economy."  This was another comment that made me reflect on my own experiences as a consumer (especially in the younger generations) and how I have contributed to this problem and cycle. Packard’s “The Waste Makers” was a reminder and a wake-up call about the evermore clear and disappointing understanding of companies’ and industries’ active consumer cycle that facilitates arguably the most wasteful aspect of society and culture today.




<br><hr>
The part that stuck out to me most about your comment was wanting to be one of the "cool kids" back in the day. I always thought that if I had the latest and greatest thing that I would fit in, rather than just expressing myself in my own ways. The weird culture surrounding apple products continues to blow my mind to this day. I am guilty of being an apple user myself, but I too cannot understand why everyone rushes to get the upgrades as soon as they come out when the phones do pretty much the exact same thing. People say it's for the camera quality sometimes, but I could not tell you who has an iphone 11 or who has an iphone 7 based on the pictures people post on social media. I also thought about apple products when reading the chapter "Progress Through Planned Obsolescence" and how the older the iphone is, the slower it is. I still had the iphone 4 when the 7 came out and it would overheat, was significantly slower, and alltogether stopped working. Apple really plays its consumers right in so many different ways, and although I am completely aware of it, I shamefully continue to use their products.

I knew marketing was a powerful tool, but didn't realize just how powerful it was, especially back in the 1950's and 60's. Today, we are accustomed to having the best and brightest in tech. An amazing technology in the 1950's seems rudimentary by today's standards. Consumers at the time were captivated by never before seen products that had the potential to make their lives better and easier. The marketing heads of companies preyed on this, sending the public narratives that bigger and newer is better. This contributed to a "keeping up with the Joneses" approach where Americans didn't want to be left behind in the consumerist race. It's wild how a few clever slogans or marketing campaigns can totally shift the psychology of a nation and build a consumer culture that lasts to this day. Overall the book reminded me of the show Mad Men, with swank ad execs thinking of the best way to squeeze more money out of the American people. 

  <br><br>

As for the planned obsolescence that Packard discussed, this is still a problem today. The company that comes to my mind when I think of planned obsolescence is apple. Apple practices planned obsolescence in multiple ways. One way is through operating systems. If you own an older phone, such as an iphone 4 or 5, and update your OS to the newest version, your phone is likely to run much slower and not be able to perform its base functions. Left with no choice, you'll give in and buy a new phone. I had an iphone 5 for about 4 years before last spring when it just stopped working. I didn't do anything to make it stop working, but it began malfunctioning out of the blue and I was forced to upgrade. Another practice apple employs is introducing new phones with fancy features on a regular basis. This encourages customers to keep up with the newest trends in tech and buy a new phone. I am hopeful that consumers will begin to invest in more expensive, quality products that will end up being the better long-term investment both for them and the planet.

I agree, marketing had a huge impact on the development of consumer culture, and still continues to do so. Imagine how many ads we see throughout the course of a day, whether it’s on our phones or on television or other media. Everything is claiming to make us happier, make our lives easier, make us look prettier. But most of it is bullshit, for lack of a better term. Producers want us to believe that we are defined by our stuff, which has created a toxic consumer mindset in our society. In terms of planned obsolescence, they use consumer culture to their advantage. If they can convince us that we “need” the newest version of their product, then we will buy it. Many people I know continue to buy new iPhones because their old ones stop working when a new one comes out. This is a manipulative yet effective technique to keep us hooked on purchasing. In order to stop this process, we the consumers need to resist it. If the demand for more sustainable goods increases, then so will the supply.

The book The Waste Makers, written by Vance Packard during the 1960s, is a pioneering work addressing the consumerism nature. In contemporary American industries, the capacity to produce outweighs the capacity to consumer due to the growing efficiency of productive force and expansion of productive facilities and assemblies. While there is increasing commercialization that reinforces the economic growth, there must be sacrifice in terms of natural resources and environmental damage. Based on the Say’s Law, people will consume eagerly everything their nation’s economy can turn out for them, no matter whether the product is detrimental to their own health. As the example of the tobacco campaign in Ken’s video has pointed out, the harmful impact of smoking doesn’t prevent normal individuals from consuming, and the tobacco industries continue profiting from human suffering. I was shocked to learn how the ad of Joe Camel is prevailing even among six-year-old kids. Each coin has two sides. With new products being promoted, there must be waste and abandonment of the oldest ones, and this is where the planned obsolescence comes in. From my perspective, we should change this radical culture of consuming more and discarding more simultaneously, and start to value quality over quantity.

I really enjoy how you bring up the analogy of Camel and cigarettes - the comparison that Ken drew to in his lecture video. When Camel, the cigarette company, realized that people were attacking their brand - and subsequently their industry - for not only incidentally selling their product to minors, but being linked to lung cancer, their corporate tops immediately looked at the facts and attempted to debunk them. Instead of making sure that they could to improve their product, or take it off of the shelves, economists and corporations try to avoid or dodge any allegation and controversy because they want to protect their product. They look to use their resources the most efficiently and try to get the most out of them as they possibly can. This is where the idea of fast fashion comes in. Fast Fashion companies want to make sure that consumers understand that they only have a limited amount of resources for specific items, so that when they release a product, people must buy it because they will not have the opportunity to buy it again.

After reading The Waste Makers, it has become evident to me that consumerism is one of the biggest threats to the environment and planet. Consumerism has created us into waste machines and it doesn’t help how companies now create products to be disposable. Products such as phones, clothes, toys, etc. all receive “upgrades” or trends change in order to keep us the consumer to keep buying the latest versions of them. Even cars are designed to only last around 10 or 11 years. Cars are one of the worst things to upgrade as well due to the how much is emitted in just the creation of just the car itself. Companies do this on order to keep their business up and profits up. They do not care at all about the harm they do to the environment and will not change their ways. Us as the consumers must either buy less, use products for longer periods of time, or buy from more eco friendly companies. 
  <br><br>

One way I try to lower my carbon footprint is by thrifting or using apps such as Depop or Letgo to buy items such as clothing or technology off of people who do not want them anymore. Although it isn’t much, it is better than going to large companies and supporting them by buying brand new products off them. Luckily the current trend is thrifting as more and more people are becoming aware of the problems of supporting fast fashion companies or most large companies.

After reading several chapters of "The Waste Makers," there is one phrase that kept recurring in my mind. The simple phrase is "they don't quite make things like they used to." Although simple, I grew up constantly hearing this phrase being rather angrily spouted by my parents and grandparents whenever something would break around the house. Being so young, I never really thought twice about this phrase and often times thought they were just being dramatic; I mean how could a product made in the 2000s possibly be of lesser quality than something made in the prehistoric 1900s? Reflecting back now, I can find some truth within this phrase and I think it no doubt ties into the machine like consumer and industry relationship America upholds today. In fact, it is almost imperative that consumer goods eventually break in order to keep the economic profit of the industry happy. It appears that American industry was not always this way, but rather became so focused on "making waste," in order to maintain the economic industrial boom after WWII. I find it rather sad that I am so used to having to constantly replace goods compared to my older relatives. In regards to the question of "whose at fault for the massive amounts of waste produced?" my only answer would be capitalism. The drive for money, and money alone, seems to be a continual rationale behind all of these industrial companies. Whether it be fossil fuel companies like Exxon or clothing companies like H&M, the concern for the environment is NEVER placed at the forefront of any agenda, but instead how they can make the most money in the quickest amount of time without having any major social repercussions. In the end, it is up to us as consumers to no longer fall victim for these capitalist oriented marketing techniques and to become increasing vigilant about what we buy and where we buy it from if we want to make any impact towards making a sustainable future.

They absolutely don’t make things like they used to. They make them so much worse. In a decade where technology advanced immensely, manufacturers still make the conscious decision to make things that break faster so we have to buy more of them. Recall the Apple iPhone scandal where the company was caught slowing the performance of older models of the phone. Apple, one of the most innovative and advanced technology companies in the world, made the decision to make phones that would break so their customers would continue to come back and buy new ones. This is happening in the 2010s, when a company like Apple should have no problem manufacturing cellular phones that do not lose performance value over time.
   <br><br>
It’s really not their fault though. It’s the system. Capitalism rewards companies who choose to make things that break easily. It’s much more profitable. In an economic system that had more regulations on waste and environmental protections, maybe this wouldn’t be so large of an issue. But that’s not the reality that we live in. And capitalism surely isn’t going anywhere. Our government needs to take a long look at the repercussions of our ridiculous amounts of waste and perhaps consider some ways to prevent companies from completely gaming their customers. The customer should not only be right, but the customer should have rights, too.

For being published 60 years ago, virtually everything mentioned in this book has been applicable today. Packard effectively communicates the problems with our saturated market, economic growth, our “throw away” culture, and the practices of companies using obsolescence of desirability, quality, and function. In chapter 2 I found the fact that 2 out of 5 things people owned could be classified as non-essential. I feel as though today that number could be higher as we have more money to spend, things are cheap, and our consumer culture pushes us to buy more. When it comes to chapter 3, I learned the concept of Say’s Law, which I had never heard of before. It is the notion that people will automatically consume goods that are produced by the economy. During this time period, people assume that any growth is good, and the longer this continues, the more it turns people into mindless consumers. It was almost essential for a company to operate under the notion that people have wants that they just don’t know yet, and it was their job to convince these people that they should want to buy a new product. Chapter 4 embodied the notion that people always have room for more stuff, they just need a new excuse to buy the product. The part that stood out the most to me was the company Midas, which used to paint mufflers. Midas hired psychologists in order to teach personel how to act around women to make them want to return or invest in a painting. I am sure this is a practice that continues today -- companies hiring psychologists to tell them how to best manipulate customers -- but I think it is a disgusting and deceitful practice. Chapter 5 was about waste, and how companies transitioned into making cheap products that were easily replaceable, and demonstrate to consumers that we needed quick, cheap, and disposable things to make our lives easier. And who wouldn’t want to make their life easier? Lastly, chapters 6 and 7 dealt with the concepts of obsolescence of quality and desirability, both of which we had learned in Ken’s English 22 class. I am in agreement with Packard that obsolescence of quality is perhaps the worst of the three. For a company to intentionally hide flaws in products, design them to break down quickly to force people to replace it, and to hastily pump products into the market is shameful. Companies should care about the products they put out and want to make them as good as they can be. They intentionally stifle technological development and raising standards of products all for a profit. It just shows that our priorities are in the wrong place, especially those who run massive companies.

I agree with you that all of the things said throughout The Waste Makers can still be applied to today's ever-growing consumer market. It seems as though people all buy items that they deem to be useful, even though it is really unnecessary, which can honestly be seen anywhere you go, especially when online shopping provides you with anything you can possibly imagine, and more, with advertisements on things you have been looking up, or happen to say to a friend. We are constantly shown advertisements everywhere we look to be sucked into buying more products that really do not benefit us besides the impulsive want to buy it for its desirability and its mediocre functionality. In the book when it said that people need quick and disposable items to purchase and eventually replace, I thought of electronics such as phones, where they are intentionally built to slow down after a new model is released, so its desirability and functionality decreases, thus our want for the newest model increases. Companies just need to make a profit, and will continue to advertise the newest version of their product as the "best," as to bring in more consumers, knowing that they will mindlessly purchase it even though a new model will release in a couple years. As we know, the batteries from these electronics are harmful to the environment, yet these companies do not care as it is just more profit for them to feast off of every time they trick consumers into buying their most "functional" product yet.

After reading chapters 2-7 of “The Waste Maker”, I wasn’t shocked
by what he had to say about consumerism. Vance Packer truly showed us the mindset
of the consumer, we by the latest thing and then once something better comes out,
we throw away what we previously had, and we just let the cycle repeat itself. One
thing that really caught my attention was when Packer said that producers don’t
even update their technology of things, they just make them prettier, so that
the consumer will want to have it and to be honest he’s not wrong, a lot of the
times ( and I am guilty for this too) people will literally buy something just because
it’s prettier, I literally went shopping with my friend and watched her by the
Iphone xs max when she already had the iphone x just because it looked prettier.
Something that really shocked me, was the fact that the government literally
ask farmers to overproduce products that aren’t even needed, which is just sad.
   <br><br>






Frankly consumerism is just going to get worse and worse in
my opinion, it’s been happening since World War II and I don’t think it’s going
to slow down anytime soon.

I agree I think consumerism is definitely only getting worse. I see more and more ADS every day on all social media networks. I cannot go on Instagram or Facebook or even Youtube without being bombarded with ADS. The worst thing about those ADS is the fact that they are all things I would of course, absolutely love to have. The ADS are catered to me and my taste. Every day I am tempted to buy that dress or those shoes. 
   <br><br>
I have the iPhone 6s and it really really upsets me that Apple keeps coming out with new models, what feels like EVERY MONTH. I do not want to purchase a new phone but with new ones turning up, my old one begins to slow down and act up. And that is where they catch you. I feel forced to buy a new one but not just any other phone, another iPhone. I love the look of them and I cannot refrain from getting any other. It is truly terrible

<br><hr>
 I completely agree with you in the sense that consumerism will only get progressively worse. But to add to your comment, I also believe that Parker does a great job of showing just how much corporations are to blame for shaping the society that we see today. Not only did industries back then make products prettier to appeal to the general public, but they also pushed consumers to purchase more of their products simply by stating that "our enormously productive economy...demands that we make consumption our way of life." It is unbelievable seeing just how much, yet how little, we have changed. Back then people preserved and cherished their valued items, only purchasing new items when absolutely necessary. Today, however, we see many people buy new technology not because of its innovation but because, just as you said, "looked prettier." Furthermore, we don't see much change in regards to the schemes presented by money-grabbing industries. Even today they have us in shackles and chains, constantly having us do as they say: buy more. I just hope to see the day when most people hold on to their products instead of immediately buying new ones once they are released. Hopefully we are able to transition from a culture where we practice being wasteful into one where we are frugal.

I wasn’t shocked after having read “The Waste Maker” either. I witness this consumer culture everyday and it doesn’t surprise me to know that many companies practice planned obsolescence.
   <br><br>
The iPhone is a perfect example of how the consumer culture in America literally ‘consumes’ people and how the majority of people fall into their marketing practices. It’s interesting to think about how many people are aware that the new iPhone is sought out and desirable simply because it if newer and ‘prettier’ yet so many people still choose to pay their hard earned money for such a materialistic ‘upgrade’. I, too, am guilty of this. Advertisement industries has made this a norm and have been convincing us that we need whatever is newer and that whatever is newer is better. I think it’s important for people to realize that in most cases newer models of materialistic possessions do not add more meaning to our lives. I also think it’s important for people to realize what is actually necessary. The new number or letter next to the iPhone is often meaningless and we can choose what we add value to in our lives.

I still can't believe that when sales aren't going well, the market then tries to turn us into these beings that desire everything, they want us to want all of the things they produce, even if we might not need them. I felt kind of lied to because my whole life I've had the option to choose from multiple consumer brands and it clicked to me that they're just trying to get me to spend my money. What I thought was the freedom of choice turns out to be way marketers just get to us. They bombard us with so many things and we don't question it, we don't question our consumer culture and it's gotten us to horrible places. When Packard started giving examples of the things that are usually presented to us in various choices are things like bathing suits, furniture, radios, and even color matching for home furniture and outfits. There's no need for us to have more than we need but we are made to think that we do, we are taught that "more means better" but it doesn't. I also find it crazy that the text itself tells us that we are the ones who are actually in control, we control the supply demand and we can change this consumer culture but a lot of people don't realize that and they get lost into the world of having to buy things.

After reading "The Waste Makers", I did not realize how severe the overproduction of the market is. I would like to point the “planned obsolescence" because it is astonishing that people are throwing away things that still could be use or function well. More importantly, most people did not take it seriously and still keep wasting stuff. From my perspective, it is time to stop this behavior and to save some sources for earth.

Planned obsolescence is such an awful corporate practice and I believe that laws and regulations should be enacted in order to prevent companies from forcing customers to purchase more when the original still should work. This is why I believe that more product recycling, donation drives, and other exchanges are essential during this period in history where our lives are structured around consumerism. The real issue comes back to these huge oligarchy style companies that have been de-regulated to a point where they can control near majority of market space. It is seriously time for change.

This was definitely an eye opening piece.  It just really goes to show how corporations and industries were not actually here for the benefit of those they were selling their products to, and they were here to make consumers out of the public in order to make more money.  They made it so that products eventually become obsolete, primarily in terms of the product’s function or style.  The Waste Makers shows just how Americans were transformed into the extreme consumers we are today, and quite honestly, it is disgusting.  Products have simply been made to get people to buy more and throw out more.  It makes me sad that our culture was once one of sustainability in that we used products for as long as possible, even repairing them as necessary.  However with this major consumerism, people were convinced that it is better to buy cheaper products that don’t last as long and throw them out when they lose their value or the latest and greatest product comes out to replace it.  No longer are products bought for their function and quality, but for: their style, what happens to be the trend, and status.  Materials are now used as status symbols, so if you aren’t throwing out last season’s sweater then people will look at you in disgust wondering why you don’t have enough money to purchase the newest one.
    <br><br>

In addition, it is terrible that corporations began deliberately producing things that were flawed and would have to be replaced.  Do you know how completely self-centered that is?  That is forcing harm on others for personal gain.  This new culture created the situation where people had to buy these cheapo products that would become obsolete as soon as they bought them, then continuing the cycle of buying terrible products over and over.  And don’t get me started on how harmful that is to the environment.  These corporations created a disposable culture where everything can be thrown out.  Now, why have a pot or pan when you can heat up your food in the container that it came in and then throw it out?  That takes out the hassle of washing dishes or taking the time to have worthwhile products.  With this, the environmental impact is horrifying, and there was no other reason for corporations to be doing this other than to make more money.  It’s truly terrible and so sad that our once reusable culture turned into a disposable one.  In that sense, we must go back to those ways in ending the disposable culture so as to lessen our environmental impact as well as financial and social.  All would benefit from this change except for the corporations that got us into this mess.

I think you identified an interesting element here. Not only are companies constantly changing what is “trendy” but they are purposefully limiting quality in order to sell more. The example that stood out to me the most was that of General Electric. The book describes letters showing that General Electric employees specifically requested that manufacturers reduce the amount of hours their flashlights would last from 1000 to 750. Moreover, they specifically noted that they would not be publicizing that fact in any way. This example illustrates an unfortunate paradox that is central in the reading. American manufacuring became so strong in the postwar period that consumption could not keep up. Therefore, so that they could maintain growth in the economy, the manufacturers actually ended up creating worse products just for the sake of producing more. 

    <br><br>

I totally agree with you that corporations have essentially made this a social problem as consumers have been trained to choose a disposable single-use product, given a choice. With that being the case, I can see where Ken drew parallels to the tobacco industry because the social engineering involved in these cases is really unfortunate. At the same time, I don’t see the companies changing their behavior anytime soon without intervention. Perhaps it’s time to explore regulating the lifespan of more consumer products the way we have done with car mileage. Set standards for various consumer products and, say, if your company produces batteries that have less energy than average, you receive an appropriate fine.

After reading "The Waste Makers" I truly felt a bit disgusted. Not by consumerism, but by the tactics employed by major companies. The discussion about Obsolesce and all of the other ploys used by these companies included many facts that I did not know I about. I had no idea that this speedy "use and dispose" tactic was not only planned, but actually instigated within these major companies. This entire economic history provided by this article proved truly interesting, and I am thankful to have read it. It paints our economy and the big corporations behind it in perfect color. They don't care about providing quality products. They don't care about wasting products. They only care about making money. 
    <br><br>

I do, however, understand that this was originally an attempt to better the American economy when it was un a poor state. But, once this worked for a little, America should've returned to its original consumer-company relationships. Lessening the lifespan allows for faster production of products, cheaper production of products, and more consumption of products. However, many products like this are quickly disposed of, or many are not even sold because the production to consumption ratio is off. 
    <br><br>

Looking at the three different ways in a which a product can be made obsolescent was also upsetting. It is clear that the three tactics described are still used by companies today. In reality we are being psychologically tricked into believing we constantly need new products, leading to a constant urge to consume. This in turn fuels the cycle of more product being made. 
    <br><br>

This reading made me want to be far more careful about what I buy, and where I buy it from. It also helped me to think about experiences in my life where I have seen this concepts used by companies (cough cough Apple iPhones). I plan on starting to put money towards things I know will last me a long time, and that  truly need.

I agree – Vance Packard’s The Waste Makers was a very interesting read, but one that was ultimately horrifying. It opened my eyes to how marketing drastically influences every aspect of our lives, even when we don’t realize it. It’s shocking to realize how different lives were before the rampant consumerism as opposed to now, and it’s even more shocking once you realize how much we waste in creating items. The idea of “trends” wasn’t one that existed, and throwing items away after one or two uses was looked down upon before. But, as you note, lessening the lifespan for products allows for companies to make more money – making a product obsolete is ultimately a tactic used to trick consumers into purchasing more and more. Companies enjoy the waste that we create.

Americans over the years have begun to consume more and more, but there has also been this continuous cycle that runs deep, which is to keep consuming then discarding. The work of "The Waste Makers" has done a great job of explaining this as well as expanding on the mechanics of the economy as a whole. The consumer is a valuable asset to the market and in order to keep the consumer coming back there needs to be a constant rotation of what's available. New products are intriguing and whatnot but also there's a psychological process taking place here which is succumbing to peer pressure and by doing so people feel a form of acceptance. Also, a person may feel a sense of belonging when they receive approval, so there's like this deep granted satisfaction. So, when someone is isolated or pushed aside that creates negative emotions such as feeling a lack of self-worth. With men and women, there are ways to cater to them to get them to want to purchase more products with regard to fashion or certain appliances. When it comes to women there has been a culture of constantly trying to persuade them to want more clothing and a way to get them to do so is by saying "why not have more" as it's better to have options and to be ready for every occasion (buying multiples is the way). Color matching is a big tool used as well to have more sales since now there's a need to purchase more in order to come off as having the nicer taste or wealthier, which is a smart technique if I'm being honest because when it comes down to it people like to be admired and complimented. This whole piece clearly displayed how malleable the human mind is and how industries aim to manipulate us even if consequences arise as the dollars matter more than the people. It isn't like humans as a whole are wasteful, it's dependent on what's around you as there are many communities who live with less and live very happy and fulfilling lives.

"Corporations have chosen their needs over the needs of consumers." This statement particularly stuck out to me in. the video. A lot of times I hear people say "well, if people just stopped buying stuff then the companies selling the products would be forced to make less," which okay yes makes sense to an extent but I think it is super important to remember that these companies have spent millions upon millions of dollars to shape us into the consumers they want us to be. I feel like that's been a belief I've held for a long time, but "The Waste Makers" really helped solidify my thoughts on it. I do think individual change has an impact in combatting the climate crisis, but it would be worthless change is if companies/corporations who got us here aren't held accountable. I was stunned (but not completely shocked) to see how companies have made their products obsolete to coerce consumers into buying more and discarding quicker. They've created this "throwaway spirit" so that they can gain more profits at the expense of consumers and the environment. As I was reading I kept thinking about how this book, when published in the 60s, was kind of the start of these companies creating a "throwaway culture" and now we're seeing the consequences in our modern society with the obsession of consuming products. It's become deeply engrained into our culture. We buy stuff we don't need in the first place, and then throw it out as soon as we deem it unusable or outdated. Like I mentioned before though, I really don't think it's entirely the fault of the consumer. Companies spend TONS of money on advertisements and research on how to make their products more obsolescent so that consumers will keep buying their products. I don't think it's a very far stretch to call it some form of brainwashing in all honesty. I feel that people who are aware of how bad this overconsumption is should make an effort to consume more consciously, but not everyone realizes it so at the very least there should be some sort of policy implementations that will keep companies in check and unable to take advantage of consumers.

After reading The Waste Makers, I found myself to be drawn to your comment for a number of reasons. First of all, I didn’t realize the book was written in the 1960s as I felt that the text generally aligns with the consumer conditioning that I notice today. Because of this fact, I am baffled even imagining how the techniques of increasing consumerism have transformed in the last 60 years since then. I also completely agree with your point about the various types of obsolescence being forms of brainwashing. Corporations have mastered the art of advertising to get customers to buy more than they need, as shown by the push for a need for more cars and the manufacturing of wedding bands for men being branded as necessary. As I read this text, I was reminded of something that my 12th grade Economics teacher told my class. He told us that it has been shown that often when people see the colors red and yellow together, they start salivating as they subconsciously associate it with McDonald’s. This occurs whether or not the person eats McDonald’s or even eats junk food. This occurs merely due to the extensive and intensive advertising that McDonald’s has put out over the years. While this is an extreme case, I imagine this occurs on much smaller scales all the time. Before people even learn to read, they are succumbed to capitalistic conditioning. As you stated, it is partially the responsibility of consumers to be conscious with their purchases; however, it is clear that there are strong, outside forces that make this extremely difficult to enact.


<br><hr>
I agree with you and the fact that the corporations are basically brainwashing consumers. I do believe that consumers' individual impact can be detrimental to the environment, but I think that the corporations and corrupt companies guide and manipulate our behavior. To combat this, we must be smart consumers and not fall into the traps of advertising and obsolescence.  “Tomorrow, more than ever, our life will be ‘disposable’.” I felt that this quote summarized The Waste Makers best. This can connect to last week’s reading of Thoreau and the idea that humans have become machines and our lives are tainted by the toxicity of materialism and consumerism. An astonishing fact was when Packard stated, “In some instances, the package was costing ten times as much as the product inside. Salt coming in small throwaway containers costs seventeen times as much as salt bought by the pound.” Now, in the days of Amazon and online shopping as a whole, the amount of packaging that is used is outrageous. Even if you order something very small, it will be wrapped more than enough in plastic and be placed in a box or plastic shipping bag much larger than needed. Everything about it is obnoxious and excessive. That’s what our consumer culture has come to. Our lives are filled with so much excess that we can’t even focus on what is right in front of us and we’re living to buy the next best thing.  
    <br><br>

This article was truly enlightening and it was interesting to see the root of consumerism and how it became what it is today. With all the corruption in our world, on so many levels, it is difficult to stay optimistic. Although I believe that large corporations hold the majority of the responsibility, I do feel that as individuals it is our duty to make smart choices and purchases. By realizing the psychological tactics that the advertising companies have implemented, it is easier to stray away from the mainstream consumerism and find peace in a simple life that Thoreau would be proud to see us live.

Looking at the Waste Makers it is easy to see how deep American culture has been thrown into the well of consumerism. Even though this book has aged 60 years since it was initially released, it’s message lives on now more than ever. In a time, where obsolescence is planned preemptively and new upgrades of different things being released essentially on the daily, it is hard to see any form of light at the end of the tunnel. The sad reality is that AMerica’s turn towards consumerism has had disastrous impacts on our ecosystem. I know a lot of students referenced this in the comments but it really is the perfect example, but the iphone is a great example of how this system works. As people are put on to the idea of the newest technology through various marketing strategies, they become obsessed with having the newest version. Even if the older version is still good and has use to it, people will ignore that and choose to upgrade for the idea that they are receiving the newest technology with the newest gimmicks. Big corporations realize this and thus produce items with shelf lives that are rather short considering the lifetime of the item. Because of this, there is a toxic cycle of producing and consuming with either side seeming to slow down. I wonder what the author would think if he would be able to view society and our consumerist traits today?  He would most likely just hit us with an “I told You So”

When reading "The Waste Makers", the part that stuck out to me the most was the idea of planned obsolescence.  I felt as if each chapter was addressing the issue of planned obsolescence from a slightly different angle.  The idea seems to be to create products that will become useless or be seen as useless after a short amount of time.  Instead of buying a quality product that will last for a long time, consumers are being trained to buy a bunch of cheap short term products.  
    <br><br>


The interesting part of this is that the American public is generally aware of this planned obsolescence.  A good example is what happened when GM and Ford started planning for their cars to break down after 5 years.  Toyota gained a huge portion of the market (ultimately tanking GM and Ford) just by exposing the deliberate flaws and selling a product that was meant to last.  So this idea is not new to most Americans.  

    <br><br>

Despite the relative knowledge the public possesses, we still have a dangerously excessive consumer culture.  This comes primarily from the advertising industry.  The Waste Makers talks about how these people decided to start selling additional houses and appliances and cars to people in order to keep the economy strong.  Many people now own several times more than what they need for survival, which will be detrimental for our planet.

As you stated, this excessive consumer culture is dangerous. Dangerous because truth and trust are both being tested. It is now a sad reality that advertising and marketing, even from reputable companies like GM and Ford, are out to deceive you. In reading "the Waste Makers", such a depressing analyzes of American culture left me with a sense of hopelessness. How can we fight against a system that forces an excessive consumerist-mindset on to us? Surely you can advise to take better care of the things you own and to consider adopting a minimalist lifestyle, but when essential commodities like phones or cars are designed to have a short lifespan, specifically to perpetuate the cycle of excessive consumerism: what then, can we do? Stop buying phones and cars? 
<br><br>
Vance Packard exposes the culture of mass consumerism in America and explains exactly how it is we became like this. I was surprised to learn that Americans once valued their personal belongings to such a level that they would hold onto things for years and years until it simply did not work. Compare that to today's culture where some people buy a new iphone every November. To some, America is synonymous with the big, extravagant, and luxurious.
<br><br>
lthough you state that American public is generally aware of companies' intent on influencing an excessive consumerist culture, I would argue that the general population is not aware, for if they were, there would be an outrage. Seeing as things are now and noticing that people are not up and arms about this issue just goes to show that ignorance is bliss.

<br><hr>
I also found the idea of planned obsolescence particularly interesting. It helps further our destructive consumer culture as we get used to the idea of getting rid of our possessions every so often as they become obsolete. Apple has been sued within the last few years for planned obsolescence as the batteries they use deteriorate over time. They also began to slow down the CPU on aging phones in an effort to keep the batteries alive longer. It has become normal to get a new phone or a new car relatively often since the new models are constantly being rolled out as bigger and better. Our consumer culture has been being built up to this point for decades through various marketing tactics that take advantage of natural human tendencies. These tactics are manipulative and deeply ingrain our consumer culture as early as possible.



<br><hr>
I had also learned about planned obsolescence previously, especially pertaining to Apple products (which are designed to apply to all three types of planned obsolescence in my opinion). I didn't know about the three different types and how companies could manipulate those in order to perpetuate a consumerist culture and persuade people to buy their products through social pressure or necessity after they break down.

    <br><br>

I also find it interesting that America is aware of these marketing techniques and still buys into them. It's shocking to me that this book is based on information from 50-60 years ago and still pertains to how our advertising works today, and very little has changed. While the numbers are outdated of course (I expect the "two fifths of the things the avg American owns are things that are not essential to their physical well-being." stat is a much higher fraction now), the general idea that our culture is founded on throwaway attitudes and paying for unnecessary conveniences out of laziness has remained the same despite evidence that this doesn't make us happier or healthier.

I remember hearing a story or something about a company selling a product that never broke. I'm not sure if a real company faced this or not but because everyone only bought the product once, they eventually went bankrupt because they couldn't make profit in the long run. I feel like companies that practice planned obsolescence are able to do so because there are no consequences against them when they do such a thing. Apple was sued for slowing down old Iphones without notifying the customer. Apple said they did it to prolong the life of the product but any company can just say that. Why would a company say they're slowing down their product so that people will upgrade. This case shows that if they wanted to, a company could just go ahead and gimp a product after a new product comes out and give another excuse of why they did so. There is just nothing stopping them from doing so. And since that idea is so ingrained into society to just buy new things, the demand for new items is always high so that companies have an incentive to push out new products and possibly slow down their older products or force them to break in time.



<br><hr>
I too latched on to the idea of planned obsolescence. It seems to me that by now there should be some regulation requiring companies to at the very least state whether their product is designed to break, thereby not robbing the consumer. I feel as though even the free market capitalists, who champion competition, could get behind this because this would actually allow competition to make products better. If companies can't get away with lying to their consumers, their only option is to actually design better things. 

    <br><br>

Then again, you also pointed out that we're fairly aware of planned obsolescence as a concept,  and yet continue to buy from companies who implement it in their designs. That makes me wonder: do we actually want things to need to be replaced? Is our phone dying prematurely just another excuse for us to go out and buy another shinny new thing? I think there may be some truth to this, and frankly it disgusts me. We're so attached to consumerism, the culture of it at least. While in the sixties it may have been the case that people consumed out of a sense of duty to the economy, that's dropped away as an excuse now. Consumerism in its modern form is not some noble pursuit of a functioning market. Nor is it an attitude of respect for our stuff. If we actually cared about our stuff, we'd take care of it, not want it to break, and not be in such a rush to replace it. No, what we're addicted to is the act of buying: the rush that hits for about five seconds when the card is swiped and our brain is hit with the right accents of freedom, self dependence, and power that satisfies what we consider to be "the American Dream", in its smallest and most achievable form.

Planned obsolescence was also one of the major things that stood out to me in this reading. The idea is usually that technology advances with society so the fact how companies would purposely make things that would break really exposed the greed of these companies. It was even stated how engineers were frustrated that they were not suppose to make things that would last. And it is not as simple as that, I was shocked to read how companies would essentially train humans since they were children to get used to having things be replaced and put noticeable effort in making that seem normal. For example making plastic toys that break easily or clothes that wear out fast show kids from a young age to buying new things is ok and even good. Another example was when a potato peeler making company would purposely color their product brown so it gets thrown away with the scraps but made the packaging bright so it still catches consumers eyes in the market and through this the company heads expected a major increase in sales. The wastefulness here truly shows the problems with the consumerism culture that companies push on the American public that are so extreme that a company would intentionally try to waste a perfectly fine product just to sell more.  A big problem that also surprised me was how this problem seems largely American. What comes to mind was the appliance expo that happened years in the past but is still relevant today where European appliance makers were confused why American appliances were so big and had so many unnecessary functions.  The idea that America supersizes everything is a bit of a stereotype but seems to come from companies such and even now all things are still getting bigger from homes to appliances and to cars. To fix this I believe regulations have to be put in place for companies to emit less greenhouse gases which lead to them producing less or smaller products or best case scenario, both. This can be one of the many ways to change the consumer culture and help save the environment.

The idea of planned obsolescence in “The Waste Makers” stood out to me as well. I always knew that an idea like this existed in all businesses that create products, but I never had an official name for it, until now. This is a smart plan for businesses because it will generate them for income, which is what leads to a successful business. It may be good for that reason, but it is horrible for an even greater reason. This idea of planned obsolescence is horrible for our planet because we are unnecessarily producing more things. 
    <br><br>

As you mentioned, the public does know about this, and has known about this for quite a while. The reason the public has continued to consume and consume despite knowing this is because we believe more things make us happy but of course, they do not. Now that this issue of climate change is becoming bigger I hope the public can change their ways and go against this idea of planned obsolescence. I would say the best way to go against this idea is to take care of our things and try our best to use and buy only things that we truly need.


<br><hr>
"Unchecked consumerism" that is the main point in the reading "The Waste Makers". It is all based on the fact that people now buy clothes to use once or twice, but discard it afterward as it either went out of style already or they've worn it "too many times". Clothes are no longer valued at the same level that they used to be because people can find companies that sell really cheap, cute, fashionable clothes. With the amount of money they can spend on a name brand pair of jeans, they can buy five different knock-offs and still have enough money to buy a shirt to match. Consumerism has reached a point that can no longer be contained or covered up.
    <br><br>


In the reading, planned obsolescence was brought up various times, this goes hand-in-hand with unchecked consumerism. People have fallen in the trap of huge corporations that have brainwashed them to believe that the pieces of clothing they just bought are no longer useful. This creates the idea that they need more clothes for new outfits because they no longer have "anything to wear," this has become a common ideology for women. It is always included in a clip or movie where the female needs to get ready for an event, the first thing she does is throw out like 20 pieces of clothing every minute and at the end of "looking" claiming she has nothing to wear. It has become part of the women stereotype.




<br><hr>
The idea of planned obsolescence is also what stood out to me the most. Too me, it was fascinating to think about, especially with the fact that it really is the case with just about everything. Sure, the Toyota cars that only last five years are a big issue, but what about the smartphones that barely last one year at this point? The clothes that last no more than a few months? Even things like room decor seem to go out of fashion or have to be replaced constantly. The pressure to get new stuff for every single aspect of your life is astounding, and the public adds to it. They know about it, they say they don't like it, and yet they feed into it more and more every day. Everyone is constantly pressuring everyone else to own more, or if not to own more then to own new, thus getting rid of the old and buying more. The whole culture is toxic and terrible for the planet.

<br><hr>

I agree with you that the idea of planned obsolescence was very eye opening. With our access to online shopping and extremely fast shipping I can see how consumers want to buy a lot of cheaper products instead of less products of more quality. Like you  mentioned, the American public is aware this is happening, however it does not prevent people from consuming. It has become part of life to have access to anything and everything even while it may be useless products. The satisfaction that people get to find new products and buy new products is what keeps them in the cycle of consuming. With technology, advertising has strengthened and now everything is so personalized that more people fall into consumer culture.


<br><hr>
The ideas of planned and perceived obsolescence remind me of "The Story of Stuff" by Annie Leonard. America has indeed fallen into this consumerist trap, constantly seeking the newest and best versions of products because we are literally fed that throughout the day, from our interactions with the world, especially through advertisements. I found it interesting that you said most Americans are aware of this. I agree that most of the public is aware of this phenomenon, but may not necessarily understand it fully or know the term. I had not heard of these ideas until I read the book, "The Story of Stuff" but I have definitely thought about this concept before.

People always use the consumption to fill their desire. Many terms they bought are not used very often. I do not want consumption become a common culture around the world. The fast fashion not only produce waste ofr people, but also put some pollution ti the nature. the water, the air are conminated by them. If people can contol their desir to buy too many things, there will be another picture. We should protect our planet. Reducing the consumption is a very effcient way. We can ask ourselves before we purchase something that do we realy need this item in our life. We mucst consider this problem again and again to avoid some unnecessary wastes.

As the book "The waste makers" said, two fifth of things we own today are unnecessary to our daily needs. These things are wasted because they don't function in the proper way. Count from person to person, these products are causing a huge number of wastes for our planet. Manufacturing the products release greenhouse gases and cost money and labor. However, some of these products are not utilized well then abandoned by their buyers. They become the waste and hard to be recycled. Annually the number of waste created by human beings are increasing, which contributes to the climate crisis. Mentioned in "Minimalism" and "The true cost", people have increasing desire to buy stuff each year, whatever needed or unneeded. I believe it is because the economy in US is going well, so that people have more income and energy to satisfy their material and emotional demands. The method they achieve these demands are purchasing "anything" they want which would make them happy. Some of them make sure they have every common domestic appliances in their house, such as TV, oven, stereos, which would rarely use. Part of people follow the fashion. The fast rotation of fashion allows customers buy the new products frequently. Clothing companies usually make promotions like ads to attract the customers to buy more stuff they don't need. This is a big trouble regards the Earth and cloth workers. The increasing demand means higher rate of production. More resources on the Earth are consumed and cause more greenhouse gas emission. Workers are pressed in the high-risk and tensive working environment. It will finally bring disaster to the society which is because of the high demand market.

From the perspective of tobacco companies, as Ken said in his video, they are still promoting people to purchase their cigarettes while they do not encourage people to smoke. This is ironic because these companies are gaining high profits by selling the harmful and additive products. The companies should take a part of responsibility of the waste made of the planet because they push the customers to buy the product which they actually do not need in order to make profits on it. However, it is contradictory to argue these actions because US economy depends on sales to grow.

I’m glad that you brought up the idea of consuming to meet our “emotional demand” as “The Waster Makers” reading emphases that what it is we seem to be purchasing has hardly an relevance to our daily needs. I agree with you Kristina, it seems that being in what is considered a “healthy” economy only pushes us towards consuming more and more. People don’t often take into consideration how much damage whatever product they are purchasing has on our planet. Manufacturing goods has such a negative impact on our environment it can nearly be compared to the warning labels on cigarettes, an explicit warning on how much were impacting ourselves and those around us. Unfortunately our society has taught us at a very young age that consuming more and at larger scale is equivalent to what a “good” citizen does, this is why fast fashion, constantly updating technology and “convenient” disposables are so successful, because we are taught that “new” is always better. This is a cultural problem we really need to start focusing on changing, our own habits and the ones we pass down have a huge potential to change the amount of and production process of goods. As mentioned so much of what we buy whether its food, clothes or anything else is hardly ever actually used. As consumers we can’t rely on corporations and companies to teach us to consumer smarter as their profits will always be at stake. I like the comparison Ken makes to the tobacco industry as I see many industries work this way as well. Although most products are advertised as “the best of” some are solely released and expected to be known to be greater and better thus being craved by consumers, items like the yearly release of an iPhone or trendy clothing. These have become such focal points to how we show off our wealth that they’re almost expected to be known as “better”.

Consumerism has grown in the United States because of the encouragement from President Eisenhower and others in power who told people to consume in order to end the recession.  The recession was the start of consumer culture; people were not only buying stuff they needed but stuff they wanted. As time went on, Americans were still expected to consume to uphold the economy and now the average American consumes twice as many goods than Americans did before WWII. Americans consumption is expected to keep growing. People are no longer just buying what they need, but they are buying multiples of products. It’s easy to consume when people are not being told the environmental factors their actions have. Whatever is produced is meant to be purchased right away for the economy to flourish. When Americans were not buying fast enough, economists developed nine strategies to make them want to purchase goods. This was the start of gendering products to get more consumers, this would increase consumption because people were no longer allowed to use one of the same thing but now they needed two. They marketed heavily to women, knowing that looks are something that they are trying to uphold through matching and keeping up with fashion. Not only were people being encouraged to buy more but they were also being encouraged to discard old goods, so that they could buy newer and better products. Something I found interesting while reading was how American products are much bigger than other countries with the same product. A point that Ken made that stood out to me, was when he mentioned in the video how the tobacco industry did not take accountability when people found out the harms that come with smoking cigarettes and instead still continued trying to get more people on the bandwagon. This is only proving how industries are not going to take accountability for their actions and that it is up to us to find the harm in what our actions do (they are never going to reveal this to us) and find ways to limit our carbon footprint. Although to some extent, I would blame the consumer because I do think it is up to us to question where the things we consume come from (to really appreciate them) it’s obvious that marketing was the main factor to consumer culture in the United States.

The Waste Makers discusses why people continue to buy more and how producers get people to do so. It is very interesting to me how companies think of ways to get people to keep consuming and with very little thought of the consequences. Additionally, the reading paints a picture of how lazy people have become, always opting for the new gadget that makes tasks even more convenient. 
    <br><br>

I did not realize that the government put out ads to encourage people to buy and consume to get out of the recession America was in. People took to these slogans because they often referred to unemployment, such as “buy now, the job you save may be your own”. People thought the government was being helpful in trying to get America out of a recession but instead, by encouraging people to constantly consume, it created a bad habit and a system reliant on people consuming things they do not need.

I could not believe after taking in all this information, how much we treat the planet like garbage.  Ken's lifetime was the one that saw all the change occur, I on the other hand was born into it.  I am appalled and ashamed to be a part of a culture that poisons the planet.  Despite being encouraged by advertisements to continually buy and continually discard it.   It seems like our lack of attention span is actually what did us in.  Our obsession with speed has destroyed everything.  Our insatiable need to impress our peers and do it quickly is at the root of every destructive business practice.  Fast fashion is build on the premise that yesterdays fashion makes you and outcast, and staying ahead of trends is the ultimate ego booster.  Fast fashion leads to even faster waste, piling up in places like west africa, where tattered and useless garments fail to provide any real help.  We can't stop our selves making waste, sending waste, burning waste and dumping waste into our ecosystem.  When you treat your home like a trash can you cant be too surprised when it starts feeling like youre living in a trash can.  It feels like the earth can't sustain this because it cant.  Never before has the scale of industrialism and production been so large and widespreads.  We simply have gotten too big for our Earth, and she is starting to fight back to kick us off.

In Vance Packard's "The Waste Makers" i got to know multiple ways producer made consumers want to buy more and more without the realization of the overconsumption, which in turn lead the problem of overproduction as well in some degree. The statistics is shocking, that I believe little of us could realize we have purchased these many things without noticing. The firms are selling at the level that they only consider their profits without concerning about the overproduction, wasting and damage to the environment it led. Under the influence of the so-called fashion industry, we are buying more and more things catch our eyes even without weighing their utilities. This shopping pattern of people is terrible, as being the waste of our own money, the waste of energy/resources produce the merchandises, and the root of most kinds of damage urban society post on the nature, which means this has to be stopped.

you made some great points about overconsumption and evil marketing strategies. To expand on Wendy's ideas, it was interesting to me how Vance Packard described obsolescence, and how companies use it to their advantage by encouraging people that their stuff is going out of use by means of function, quality, and desirability (55). I can easily understand how new products can become more functional or desirable overtime, but what puzzled me the most was the idea of obsolescence of quality. If you buy a good quality product, it should last you for a good amount of time (hopefully, your whole life). However, Packard describes obsolescence of quality as “when it is planned, a product breaks down or wears out at a given time” (55). The key word I found here was planned. This marketing strategy is used when companies know that they will make a newer product soon and want to ensure that people will continue to buy more and more. The first company I thought that uses obsolescence of quality is Apple. When you buy a new iPhone or MacBook, it works super great for a few years. Then Apple comes out with newer versions of these same devices and wants you to buy these too. For some reason, our Apple products slow down (connection) over time, forcing us to buy the newer product. Because out original Apple products worked so well in the beginning, we will still want to buy from this company, and thus, Apple is winning. But, what exactly is making our devices break down? Is there some big button that they push at the Apple headquarters when a new product comes out to slow down these older products? People who work for Apple are geniuses; they have to know a way to make an iPhone or MacBook that will last forever. They only choose not to because they know that they will make more money from selling and selling again to the same customers. And, connecting back to Wendy’s comment, the American shopping problem is ridiculous, and we will continue to buy, buy, buy thinking that we need the newest and best products available. Therefore, the company is always beating us.

After reading the assigned chapters of Vance Packard’s book entitled, “The Waste Makers,” on how people in the United States during the 1960s consume a whole lot more than they should and how this consumption is overall truly harming. In reading this particular reading I was not surprised by what Packard was discussing, explaining how the United States became the “defense of spending,” and nearly reached a tenth of the nation’s whole output of goods and services. Packard explains how this is driven by marketers and their strategies they create to increase their sales of consumer goods and services. This information was not surprising to me because I have realized that consumerism is a problem in our society and many people buy items they do not necessarily need or just buy to keep up with the current trend. Vance Packard talks about the idea of fashion and how marketing plays a key role in keeping up with current fashion trends. He says that companies will waste no time in creating new items or altering their style just for the new trend of the week and then change it days or weeks after one dies out and there is then a new one. Packard states, “style can destroy completely the value of possessions even while their utility remains impaired.” This specific statement by Packard stuck out to me because this to me explains the problem with consumerism, meaning that even though an item is still in great condition, it will be considered old due to that item no longer being on the top of its line or something better comes out in place of it.
    <br><br>

American consumerism is now considered a problem because it is a reflection on the condition of the earth which is the climate crisis. I, unfortunately, do not see how this problem can get better. This problem has not gotten any better since the 1960s and I feel as though Americans and businesses have gotten used to this type of society. Companies are going to continue to try to increase their marketing sales because that's their ultimate aim and Americans are going to continue to want to stay up to date with the latest trends and fashion.

I agree, after reading “ The Waste Makers”, I was not shocked at how America has become what is known as a consumer culture. Our constant need to have what is new, regardless of what we already own, is alarming. Vance Packard reminded us that we live in a throw away culture, one that prioritizes luxury items over necessities. Hearing that 2/5 of what we own is not essential, served as a good wake up call. So often we feed into the idea of a consumer culture, with no care as to how the environment is impacted. After reading this, I was motivated to be more discerning before buying items that I want, but don’t need. 
     <br><br>

I was angered to hear how this agenda is being led by marketing and advertising companies throughout America. Americans are being misled, as they are taught that buying material goods helps the economy and is therefore their individual responsibility. While having a booming economy is good, we must consider what that does to consumerism and our planet. Notions that bigger is better and throwing goods out is easier than returning them is harmful to our planet. Items don’t actually go out of style every few months but yet, we are being led to believe that we must keep up with the current trends. I was ashamed when reading this, as I know I contribute to this consumer culture. While I am going to try my best to make small changes in my life, I struggle to see how this will change in America. Businesses continue to market to the public that we need to purchase more, leading us into a downward spiral.
<br><hr>
Your comment caught my attention through elaborating on the effects of marketing on the fashion industry. I believe that these marketers who purposely design items to be thrown away are evil, for lack of better words. The intent of making a product, only to be replaced by something "better" in a year is incredibly wasteful. Unfortunately, our society has succumbed to this lifestyle, and almost anything is disposable. I am afraid to say that I fall victim to this trend. Every day, I pack snacks with me to take to school so that I can sit through classes without my stomach grumbling. I use multiple plastic Ziploc bags every day to hold cookies, chips, fruits, or anything else that is small. Once I consume my snacks, I throw the bag away in the trash can. If I had every single Ziploc bag I've used in my lifetime laid right in front of me, I'm positive that the pile would be taller than I am. Our society is obsessed with the convenience of disposable items because we don't have to think about it once we throw it away. However, being enrolled in this class has turned my attention to my personal usage and waste. 


<br><hr>
I agree with Packard's statement about the style of items. We used to buy things that would last a long time and still be functional. Nowadays we care more about the style and looks of items instead of their functions. While I think it's nice to buy things that look nice and clean, we shouldn't make it a priority. It's stupid to throw away things that are still perfectly usable just because it's not fashionable. It's like how they made cars into fashion statements so that automobile companies can make more money. They make them look fancy and elegant and sell them for more money even though they aren't that much better than a regular car. Nowadays, every car brand releases a new car model every year. These new cars aren't very different than the previous year's car. Even worse, they're super expensive and lose most of their value once they leave the dealership. But still, people keep buying a new car every year so that they can drive the newest, most elegant car even though cars can last a very long time. This is made worse by all the commercials promoting these brand new cars.

It was hard to digest the fact that American producers are finding it harder and harder to create burning desires in consumers because I feel like every document we have read or watched for this course has been contrary to this statement. I thought the problem was that we live a never-ending consumer lifestyle and what we need to learn is to stop wanting. After watching “The True Cost” I was convinced Say’s Law was completely true since there is always an eager market. I’m confused when this switch happened because I still see this to be true. When looking at the economics of consumerism, it does not add up that there is more being supplied than demanded. 
     <br><br>


When I hear the word obsolescence, I instantly think of Forever 21. You buy a shirt you don’t need, you wear it once, you throw it away. While this does not necessarily apply to me, since I shop extremely consciously and sustainably, it applied to many teenage girls in Forever 21’s prime. Homecomings, proms, and formals would have the stores filled to the brim with sequin cocktail and floor-dragging dresses. The girls wore the dress once and it suddenly sat in their closets for ages with no other purpose. All of my special occasion dresses were bought secondhand and bought with their multiple purposes in mind. I even loaned them out to girls after I had graduated for even more use out of the dresses. Plus who knows how many times it was worn and passed down before I got my hands on it at the thrift store. It warms my heart a bit to know that I was attentive to sustainable fashion so early on and have now spread that to my circle of friends who I hope will continue the tradition. When I read that “our economy is based on obsolescence,” my eyebrows raised and I read the sentence over. Wow. It truly is true. Everyone has been brainwashed to believe that they need the newest jeans or the newest sandals the second they come out, making their old pair a thing of the past, never to be worn again and finally seen in a landfill. Just about every industry runs like this - fashion, auto, home appliances. All of these companies would crash if they don’t keep up with the wants of the customers for that season. Unfortunately, it is the cold truth.

I thought this reading was interesting because it takes a deep dive not just behind our consumer behaviors, but what actually drives those behaviors. I think it’s really interesting that ⅖ of the things we own are nonessential. Additionally, the section at the beginning that talks about how many appliances that come out from companies have only minor modifications are very true. For example, I remember seeing an ad on TV about a new HP laptop that has a kill switch for the web camera. If we think about it, this job can easily be done by placing a bandaid on the camera like many people do already. Reading the first few chapters made me rethink my goal of working for many companies. I previously wanted to be a user interface researchers and designer, but I think these jobs are ultimately asking the wrong questions. These jobs are centered around “how can we make this product more intuitive and convenient for the user?” but it’s time that we start demanding that companies ask “how can we simplify this product so that it limit the amount of carbon emissions in its production process?” I think this shift is really important and The Waste Makers helped me realize this.

In this book “The Waste Makers”, many quotes from marketers and advertisers is in fact beguiling the public into accepting false standards. They continuously encouraged people to consume all goods, increase their need for products and quickly update, which is literally overconsumption and is bad for our economic and environment. Many consumption is useless because people always own things with the same function like old clothes, but with their “The Throwaway Spirit”, they want to have new ones and obsolescence old things. These people have been brainwashed by fast fashion. These opinions sacrifice culture, prudence and a proper concern for the future and Vance Packard criticized them precisely.

You're absolutely right that Packard criticized them as they deserve. While I acknowledge that I am speaking in broad terms, major corporations that produce consumer goods have really fostered a waste culture in America over the past decades that is detestable. Starting after the end of WWII, companies needed to find ways to keep the industrial economy, that the war had started, moving and they began targeting consumers. The value of 'stuff' used to be determined by their content and their quality, but today that idea has been thrown out the window as companies have begun producing consumer items that are meant to be thrown away. The value of stuff today is now determined by their context and not their function, and this idea is having devastating impacts on our environment. Things should be used until they cannot anymore, and in respect to clothes I am a big proponent of subscribing to brands that embody the principles of quality and sustainability in their products. Patagonia and L.L Bean, for example, are two really good brands that will repair any of their items that you bought for them at any point and I commend them for really prioritizing their products and not their profits. My dad recently sent in an old pair of boots that he had bought nearly 20 years ago from L.L Bean that were starting to wear around the ends and the lining was starting to come apart, and a couple weeks later he got a package, and in it were his boots fully repaired! I encourage others to really be aware of what brands they associate themselves with and to prioritize the ones that really care about the quality and longevity of their products.

In "The Waste Makers" the author outlines how it is the norm to consistently buy things, and how we now purchase things because we "want" them not "need" them. After the war, it was necessary to buy things to keep the economy going, however the circumstances have changed now, but our actions have not. Having the latest and trendiest things is what defines society nowadays. Marketing and social media both put the image in our head that if we have the newest things that we will be happier, so we continue to buy in an effort to obtain the level of happiness that celebrities seem to be at. However, when we buy new things we throw other things out creating an abundance of waste, because new trends are constantly popping up, and so we have to constantly buy and throw things away in order to keep up. Today, things aren't even built to last, such as most appliances that don't last more than ten years. Personally, my family has two refrigerators and I had never thought much of it until after I finished reading this piece and thought about how we don't even fill up the first fridge that there would ever be a need to go use the one outside. I also realized how I am always convinced I need the newest iPhone when most of the time by phone at the time works perfectly fine, and the latest iPhone isn't that different than the one that I have now. Yet, I watch their video on the release of the phone and see the new colors that they came out with and I set my mind on getting that new phone. Marketing has a strong influence on the youth and it is what is causing all of this excessive waste. We need to learn to not fall for the traps that marketers set out for us, because if we continue on this path our planet will give out from under all of the waste that we have created.

I totally agree with your opinion and I also have met the same situation before. As a girl, I always prefer to buy the latest and the most fashionable clothes without realizing that I already have had a lot of clothes at home. The reason behind it is that I do not know that producing clothes will lead to release of carbon dioxide. After learning the lecture of this course,  I know how much will it increase the carbon dioxide amount in the atmosphere. Consequently, I try my best to convince myself that I do not need too much clothes and I could only buy a new one when one of the old is broken. Additionally, I do not only limit my desire to buy extra products, but also my family and friends. As an economic student, I would analyze the strategy of enterprise. They always exaggerate the good functions and small changes of their products, but we need to consider the disadvantage of buying them. Making decisions by just looking through attractive advertisement is unreasonable.  In conclusion,  all of what I have done is aiming for protecting our environment and lowering the increase rate of carbon dioxide level.

First off, I want to comment on the idea that Ken brought about the cigarette companies in the mid 1900s. It seems that every big company that thrives through the subjection of the environment or human lives refuses to accept the morality of their actions and they simply don't care how much damage they do as long as there is a profit in the end. These are ruthless companies that have one thing in mind: profit. If the environment or the safety of human lives gets in the way, so be it. This is not only seen with the big fossil fuel companies but also with the big electronic cigarette market. These companies are deliberately following in the exact footsteps as tobacco companies, re-committing every wrong doing that was done in the mid 1900s. They are specifically targeting a new generation: kids. They make all these fancy flavors and make the things taste like candy, claiming that it is for people that are trying to quit smoking. There are no cigarettes that taste anything remotely like real candy. Instead these companies want to get a new generation hooked in order to profit off of the expense of others health and ultimately lives. This isn’t surprising, however. This is a common trend. Big fossil fuel companies are committing acts along the same lines. 
      <br><br>

The waste maker was a very intriguing read and I found it quite enjoyable, especially chapter one. I really liked the picture that the author so vividly painted of what he called the “cornucopia city.” I liked how Packard made a point that in the future historians will look back and call us the throwaway age and I found it in a sad way funny that he mentioned companies lined up along cliffs exporting goods at such a fast rate that whatever wasn't taken would just be dumped out of the back door over a cliff. This was funny to me because it shows how much of a center we are as a society on consumerism. It's quite fake in my opinion that we pride ourselves on such meaningless crap and people are admired for the possessions they have rather than the type of person they are or the contributions they have made to society. We have it all backwards. 
      <br><br>

I also enjoyed Packards point about how people claim they are worried about consumerism or claim that they aren't wasteful themselves when in reality these very people are supporting the companies that produce these items for mass consumption. For example, someone could be a total minimalist but still have stocks for a big company in order to make money. Whether it seems like it at all this person is largely apart of the problem. 
      <br><br>

When I was a kid I would always ask my father why companies didn’t make items that lasted a long time and he simply told me that they design the items to break down on purpose with the intention of getting you to buy more. The whole idea of planned obsolescence is very disturbing and annoying to me.  I just find it depressing that society has become so surrounded on the focus of money that companies plan to have products expire. What a joke. On the other hand, I think that we as a culture need to step back and handle the idea of obsolescence of quality because this is largely our fault as a society and it has little to do with the companies. If people would stop tossing items because they are “out of style” then companies wouldn't keep making so many new items because  no one would be supporting the creation of constant unnecessary items.

It is really the case that when I was little, things seem to last much longer than they are now. I can still remember the first computer that my family owned. It lasted for almost ten years and accompanied my childhood. If we look at electronic devices now, we can barely use them for five years. What a significant reduction on their life expectancy! Also, some old appliances produced by Japanese could last over a decade, some of which could still be used today, while modern appliances somehow only focus on appearance and various useless functions and neglect quality. Obsolescence of quality is really a huge issue now. It prevents us from maintaining our personal connections with items that we own and costs us much more. Although manufacturers gained a lot of revenues from this process, the cost is the deteriorating climate in our home earth. At this point, how to maintain our stuff as long as possible and recycle them as much as possible is a crucial aspect in this climate fight.

"The Makers of Waste” is a very interesting read that focuses on negative impacts of consumerism culture. The statement “Style can destroy completely the value of possessions even while their utility remains unimpaired," said Paul Mazur. The more pieces people have, the more trash will end up in landfills. 
      <br><br>

The idea of fast fashion is very appealing to people. The ability to keep up with fashion in a cheap and accessible way is very convenient, however it leads to many environmental problems in the long term.

I agree. Fast fashion is attractive. No one can resist buying and acquiring new staff. However, while promoting the economy, fashion also makes people fall into the abyss. On the one hand, people spend money on these luxury goods, not necessities. On the other hand, these luxury goods also cause environmental problems.


<br><hr>

I agree that the more pieces we have, the more trash will end up in landfills. I do believe that the fashion industry has a huge impact on our society and even the world. There are the ideas of trends and seasons which come and go. The quality of clothes is also not at its finest as they wish to not make it durable that way we can consume more. Many production companies have their strategies to keep us consuming their products. We are all targeted and it is sad to say that many of us buy into their persuasions.



<br><hr>
Your take on fast fashion is nothing short of impeccable. The amount of things we buy directly relate to the amount of waste we make due to consumer culture. People should move toward buying used clothing (if needed) and move from wants to need for our life goods.



<br><hr>
I agree that it is hardly to resist the attraction of fast fashion since people always want to catch up with the trend, but it would cause some serious climate problem. The more we buy, the more trash we have and put in the landfill that is harmful to our planet. Besides, with the fast fashion becomes popular, the quality of the clothes is getting worse so that we need to even buy more which are not necessary.



<br><hr>
I couldn’t agree with you more and the points you made are concise and highly summative to me. After reading “The Waste Makers” by Vance Packard, I realized the trend of fast fashion brought by the consumerist culture is truly damaging our environment in different ways. The products made from the fast fashion industry are attractive to current consumers and they are also cheap in price, which further increases the number of consumers. This leads to a drastic increase in both consumer purchases and abandoned products. Like what Sophia has said, “The more pieces people have, the more trash will end up in landfills”. It is absolutely right that this trend brings about environmental problems because some of the landfills result in the production of leachate and detrimental gases that harm the environment and some of them are nearly non-biodegradable. 

      <br><br>

Moreover, I noticed that some fast-fashion products don’t have good quality because they were designed to be produced in a raw assembly line and the process is pretty low-tech and unsophisticated. This means that they are not as durable as other designer clothing brand and people are going to purchase more of them when it breaks, which is obviously a vicious and endless loop. One suggestion that I could come up with is that we all should consider what we really need before we make decisions.

The Waste Makers was an interesting read to read. It talked about the beginning stages of consumerism, post-war, in the 1960s. It touches on how they consumed more and more and how dangerous it is for our planet and environment. This is crazy to me, because this consumerism problem has only elevated even more in today’s world. Consumerism is at an all time high, because of the American Dream ideals. Our society has put so much pressure on the fact that the more things that someone has the better and more successful they are. For example with Apple iPhones, if one saw someone with an iPhone 5 walking around they would most likely be looked at differently than someone with the newest model iPhone; and Apple has capitalized on this ideal by now making a new phone every two years, when their current phone lives could stretch out way longer. And the idea of a McMansions, the bigger the house the more money and success one tends to associate with you, but what does one do exactly with all this space. For example on this one, a famous YouTuber, Jeffree Star, 19,549 square foot house for only about 4 to 6 people, what is that little number of people going to do with all that space? It just seems completely unnecessary. But yet we idealize this lifestyle and continue to chase it. These chapters also touched on how people use things and just throw them away, similar to the current iPhone situation. So many things get tossed into landfills, especially clothes. These items could have their lives stretched out to be even longer and longer but the fashion industry pushes new things onto consumers very fast and frequently. This consumerism lifestyle needs to be changed and we need to go back to a simple, less “american dream” ideal in order to save this planet. I think it can be doable, but is unlikely in today's world. But on the optimistic side, with a lot of time and effort it may happen, and there will still be people pushing this lifestyle and living the life of a major consumer. In order to even get the ball rolling on ending this consumerism lifestyle it would have to start at the top with the companies, which in my eyes is very very very unlikely.

I found The Waste Makers an interesting book to read as it goes a bit in depth of the consumer culture of the United States. It was quite intriguing to get more incitement about the transformation from consumerism from the Great Depression to today’s typical consumerism. By taking a closer look into this subject it is clear as day why the climate crisis is such a talked about issue as the amount consumed by the average American has risen so much due to living the ideology of the American Dream. It is without question consumerism is at an all time high like you mentioned and unfortunately you are also correct about the idea of having more means more successful. As I read through several comments about this reading it is interesting to see how many people have brought up Apple products. Understandably so as this company that already has made fortunes continue to come out with “newer” products every year and it has created an ideology of you must have the newest. As you said, seeing someone with a much older iPhone is something that people tend to recognize and have degrading thoughts about the individual. I also appreciated the fact that you brought up how as a society we tend to chase this lifestyle of more is better. I watch a good amount of YouTube and I am always just in shock how massive some of these celebrities houses are, or how many cars they have and always ask myself what is the purpose? Similarly to what you mentioned about Jeffree Star I just do not understand why one would need so much space because it is very obvious that not all of it will be used. This topic is similar to what was in last week's film about minimalism and just being able to justify all the space and items you need. Clothing might be one of the worst possessions when it comes to what is overconsumed and then wasted as fashion companies are constantly pushing out more and more fast fashion these days. The only part where I disagree with you ,and of course is just my matter of opinion, is that I am not optimistic by any means. I do not see this modern day consumer lifestyle changing ever because of how far it has gotten these industries and to be honest I only see it getting worse. I feel as though you might agree with me as even you ended your comment saying the unlikeliness of the companies changing how they do things. It is the sad reality of today’s consumerism that just simply won’t change.

After reading Chapter 2-7 of "The Waste Maker", my developing thoughts of American consumerism, as ENG23 has progressed, were sadly confirmed. Packard explains not only the increasingly fast pace of production by companies in order to increase profit, but also the psychological edge in which corporations have planted and taken great advantage in securing their profits. While it is true that "improvements" have been stalled and only made in smaller increments than necessary in order for producers to continuously feel they have a product to sell in the market, but the public has been convinced throughout generations that there is a need and status in having the most updated, or newest item available or that things have limited life spans. Ultimately, the consumer decides based on personal judgement and beliefs about what their necessities are. By making a good majority of people believe and desire to keep up with the pace of production, companies have cunningly created a foundation in which they can effectively appeal to the people with advertisements and new products. I felt that Packard greatly demonstrated the multiple facets of society that has created the climate crisis. There is a need for consumers to be more conscious of their decisions, but there is also an important need for the production sector of the economy to drift away from the idea that profit is all that matters. We have become too focused on monetary gain or value, causing us to be blinded to the wastefulness and excess we have surrounded ourselves with, claiming it is "the way of life". Consumerism and production both need to be reconsidered for their practices in order to save the dying planet.

As you’ve stated, companies definitely need to shift from the all-glorifying desire of profit that takes advantages of this toxic culture of consumerism and push for marketing to place a need of desirability and significance upon their products. I appreciate how the author of “The Waste Makers” outlines the three types of obsolescence as they are the general conditions that lead to simply more purchasing. However, the greatest threat among them that I can associate with myself is the “Obsolescence of Desirability” as I know for a fact that I have enough “material possessions” when it comes to objects like my phone or clothes yet it is a social normality for us to feel the need to buy more clothes even after using them once or twice or with a new edition of a phone coming out. Such conditions have become so normalized among Americans that we may not notice the toxicity of such things and the waste produced from doing such things. I know I am fortunate for such an experience with my family even being able to afford this type of spending or even from the money I have made from a summer job. While others may not be in the same financial circumstance in which they cannot spend so recklessly, I know I am not well off enough to just simply splurge and yet I acknowledge a desire within myself to buy more clothes or get things I want rather than I need. This is a saying from my parents as they immigrated here from another country where they were less fortunate and have taught me the importance of being frugal. While I definitely value frugality, I admit that I still feel a desire to “stand out” in the sense of materialism that has been so valued by the American media and culture. While I believe this is a general consensus that companies must put an end to such immoral practices, I believe this is a problem of both companies, consumers, and government. Because America’s economy is based on capitalism and profits off this, I believe that for consumers and companies to shift away from this “American culture” is impossible as it will definitely have detrimental affects to the economy as discussed by Packard. With recessions occurring, companies and investors become prepared by adjusting production or taking out funs; however, if consumers were to stop buying and become more aware of their spending this would definitely affect our economy in multiple ways. I think America wants to maintain their position as an economic powerhouse and industry along with companies’ desire for more and more profit. Because of this, I admit that I have a very pessimistic view towards us moving away from such a culture as a society.

I agree, after reading these chapters it just shows how much companies have to keep coming up with new ideas to stay ahead of not only each other but also there consumers. If you notice right when a new iphone comes out people are so quick to buy it even if they don’t need a new phone. They just want to keep up with the trends which is a big problem in our society. I agree with you that consumerism and production both need to be reconsidered. Even though it is hard because of all the societal norms nowadays. Everyone wants top of the line things. It’s only hurting our planet more though.

As Vance Packard states, we are a culture defined by consumption and the production of waste. Americans are increasingly being encouraged to consume more and to discard sooner. This trend extends throughout all aspects in our life such as fashion, the automobile industry, home appliances, and cosmetics. I like how you pointed out the psychological edge that plays a factor in the consumer. Consumers are buying into the obsolescence of desirability. Obsolescence of desirability creates the need for a newer product even though our current one still functions. In our minds it is ‘worn out’. The misconception that we have to keep up with the pace of production only profits the companies we purchase items from because fortunes are made from the craving of convenience. Meanwhile, our bank accounts and mental health suffer. 
      <br><br>

Like yourself I also frown upon the incorporation of limited lifespans on products because this is an intentional material failure that is embedded in products. Durability is no longer a concept in American society because product engineers have embedded a ‘death control’ in items. Many may believe this concept of death control to be unethical but in the consumer industry it is seen as socially justifiable because it redistributes wealth in society. It is all about corporation needs and not the consumer. Physical possessions are becoming too plentiful to accommodate comfortably. As Americans we need to reevaluate our purchasing choices.

The book, "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard in depth breaks down consumerism. In detail Packard, describes how being a consumer led to creating so much waste. In the beginning Packard talks about how the global economy was the main structure how the economy should work, once it collapsed president Eisenhower over simplifies the solution to fixing this problem. President Eisenhower’s solution is to buy more anything, thus prompting companies to market the civic duty as a citizen to buy more products. Companies pushed this on to the people and realized how easily they can persuade people to buy new things. Which then leads to companies marketing products that can easily be disposed of and replaced by simply buying a new product. This created the mentality that products should be easily replaceable thrown out without very little thought. This is why Packard's book is given the title it has. America has become so prone to buying things and throwing them out, that is why we produce so much waste which is bad for the environment.

I had a similar reaction to Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” and it was interesting to hear that he grew up during the Great Depression. It makes sense how greatly his upbringing influenced his views of changing times— from acting very frugal to buying and throwing away as many things as possible. It is a little shocking to hear how consumeristic the 1960’s were because I think things might be worse now, but in a different way. There are similarities in the ways we have treated clothing and fashion since we are using articles of clothing for less and less time, instead of holding on to what we have and getting its full value out of it. It really does come down to the way goods are produced and marketed to us, which determines what social pressure is put on what we “must” have. I am no expert in economics, but I feel like there could have been a different way to create economic growth, or jobs, for people that did not involve putting pressure on consumers to buy, buy, buy.

      <br><br>

There were environmentalists in the 1960s and there are many environmentalists in the 2010s, but we still see a large portion of the population overbuying and throwing away as the next thing comes. I think this is best illustrated in the mobile phone industry: Apple has a strong hold, and what seems like a monopoly, on selling phones to people across the world. They release new iPhones probably once a year, always getting faster, clearer, and more advanced. I can see how our culture has made it clear that you are not as good or wealthy as the person next to you if they have a newer model of phone; people even trade in or buy the newest model even when there is nothing wrong with their current one, they are just looking for the new, shiny one. There needs to be more regulations or scrutiny about what can be advertised or marketed, because the industry is strife with unethical tactics. We need to urge others to make more economically healthy consumer choices.

The American economy is consumer driven. I knew that. Everyone knows that. Of course there's going to be excess production. That's just how it works. It's always been that way right? HAHA. Just kidding I guess. Yet again, Ken makes me realize just how brainwashed I am by our current culture. "The Waste Makers" is hard proof that the way we consume is almost completely controlled by the companies we buy from. This book was written 60 years ago yet it is more relevant now than ever. We always want the best, the biggest, and the newest items that we can get. Phone culture is actually living evidence of this phenomenon. The iPhone X that we got last last year was working completely fine yet as soon as the iPhone 11 came out, we suddenly were in dire need for an upgrade. In my mind, that had always been a consumer problem. I thought that our need for new items had always been a byproduct of our consumer culture. What I didn't know prior to this reading was that our manufacturing companies had played an enormous part in the creation of this mindset. 
      <br><br>

In 2017, Apple was exposed to have been purposefully slowing down the operation of older iPhones in order to "protect" their batteries. Wow. Not only were they trying to sell me a thousand dollar phone, but they were also telling me that it would be purposefully made obsolete in two years. HUUUH. Who do they think they are!?!!!!?!? Up until today, I thought that this kind of consumer-producer relationship was one-of-a-kind, that only Apple was trying to trick us into buying their newer products. "The Waste Makers" proved to me that this business trick isn't just wide-spread but that its older than my grandparents. To be honest, it makes complete sense for companies to do this. If they sell shoddy products, consumers will be forced to come back and repurchase them, and the broken products that we have been forced to discard now sit in one of the millions of garbage dumps where they will wait thousands of years to decompose. This is exactly the kind of thing we need to prevent if climate change is to be addressed. Waste not, want not. This is the cultural revolution that needs to happen. We, the consumers, have the purchasing power required to make this kind of change. If something is to happen, it starts with us.

I completely connected with your comment and had a similar reaction to the reading. I also had similar beliefs about consumerism in our country and I knew we had issues but had no idea the gravity of the situation. Now I realize that it is so much more than excessive production and consumption and based less on the pure greed of a consumer but the tactical, divisive ways in these companies control us. I also was aware of this always bigger and better mentality, especially in relation to iPhone and technology sales. We are brainwashed into craving the next best thing and live in an environment where the current best thing is always fleeting with an expiration date. Where did early ideals of utilizing resources and materials to live simply and sustainably go? At the beginning of chapter two, the reading starts with the fact that we are using twice as many goods as we did just before World War II. Do we really have twice as many needs today as we did then? Absolutely not. This is why this capitalistically driven consumerist infrastructure is so unnecessary and yet it rules so many of our lives. This system is so incredibly selfish as all it cares about is the growth and incomes of these companies, while manipulating citizens and betraying our environment. 
       <br><br>
This concept of manipulative advertising is one that really makes me examine my own decisions. As Ken mentioned in his introduction videos about marketing cigarettes to kids and its effects, I wonder how much has been conditioned in me whether I like it or not. Our devices know more and more about us and every day the ads I am shown on my social media are more and more personalized to my wants. This is scary because many times I see these ads and I start to play the game. I say to myself wow how did Instagram know I needed this one specific, obscure item? I guess this is a sign I have to purchase it, but then I realize this is exactly what these companies and algorithms want me to do. The reading displays how we are societally being convinced that we need certain things to be able to feel successful and complete, but these expectations just keep getting more elaborate and expensive. We need to break this system down from the bottom up as it is having devastating effects on our environment and is all together un-humanitarian.

I shared many of your thoughts when I went through the reading. It shocked me how much of the patterns given throughout the excerpt about planned obsolescence, consumption, and the like, easily correlated to the modern world. In the 60 years since this book's creation, the consumerism culture has only gotten stronger. In a way, Vince Packard wrote about the birth of our culture and warned of the danger, yet the world ignored it. The Apple news was definitely a shocker when it first came out, but upon reflection, it really wasn't all that surprising. Today, large technology companies and other consumer brands make a majority of their profit off of repeat sales. For example, the materials of clothing, shoes, and other accessories have been continually getting worse over time in terms of how long they last. This happens in every industry, not just technology and fashion. I'm glad that "The Waste Makers" was able to help you realize how ingrained these kinds of practices are into the consumer business. Apple was really the just a big name that got caught for it at the time so of course they drew a lot of media attention. There is no doubt in my mind that none of the big companies changed their practices regarding planned obsolescence, they just got better at hiding it. I agree with your call for action, but I worry about whether that would even be enough. Purchasing power can only halt the problem so far. It doesn't stop the companies all that much as the product will stay produced and will just become even more waste, whether someone buys it or not. This can often be seen when you visit a local electronics store. They often hold electronics that are 5+ years old, which is practically dead modern technology wise. No one will buy an old Macbook Air if the new ones are faster and cheaper. So they just sit there and become waste no matter what. At this point, mass production has gotten out of hand and the only way to stop the ongoing crisis is to target that.

I agree, who do these companies think they are. There’s a shocking parallel between smoking and fossil fuel companies. the industries’ products have negative, harmful consequences to the public, so they double-down by denying science and profiting off human suffering. Addict the population to poisonous substances to addict American culture to consumerism results in killing people for profit. Whether it be directly through cancer, inadvertently through waste from fast fashion under-utilization, or indirectly through carbon emissions killing the atmosphere. Putting corporation needs above consumer’s needs have horrific results. Its easy to see how fast fashion bandwagon developed from the great depression through consumerism growth. Fashion styles are updated in a blur; therefore, the term flash fashion defines today’s fast fashion preference change. Here are some keys from the reading. Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months. Style can destroy completely the value of possessions even while their utility remains unimpaired. Consumerism culture behaves like children on a growth spirt, who outgrow their clothes and in need of new fits every blink of the eye. Because of aggressive advertising and selling campaigns for habit lag, America’s capacity to produce has outstripped its capacity to consume. Even when consumer “perform their economic functions,” the US has lost $100 Billion from product waste. New gadgets of all kinds are falling apart from use. Today, things aren’t made to last, they are made to be bought again and replaced again for more revenue. 
      <br><br>

If Ken claims its quick to adjust to a new normal for people born because those born into that culture change is their normal, then let’s be the generation to change future generation’s ways.

Reading this article made me realize how much power the industries/companies has over the "consumer-driven" culture that we live in. "The Waste Makers" makes it entirely clear how big companies manipulate their consumers into spending endlessly on new products and goods that seem to only be slightly better than the previous models. I agree with you in saying that we have become brainwashed to want the newest, the biggest, and the best items that we can get our hands on, and it seems like something new and better comes along on a weekly basis.  As consumers, we continue to buy and buy and give into the cleverness of these big companies. 
      <br><br>


Though it is easy to call these companies evil and manipulative, it entirely makes sense for them to do these practices. If they only put out extremely durable products a few times throughout the year, they would not anywhere near as much money. It's almost necessary that they shove their products down their consumers throats, because if they aren't turning out a profit with each year, the economy suffers. It's unfortunate that this is the economic system that has been around for years and years and that is completely normal to us.

Hi Jason, I had the exact same realization while reading the text. I knew too much consumerism was bad both from a money standpoint and an environmental standpoint, but I never realized our consumer culture was so driven by corporations. I always assumed it was just natural that people loved to buy things, but after reading The Waste Maker, I realize it's corporations that systematically create a consumer culture. The way products are manufactured and sold is all designed to promote a consumer culture. Packard’s main discussion of this involves teaching us about “throwaway culture” and “planned obsolescence”. He explains how corporations use different kinds of obsolescence to plan out business models rooted in consumerism. Companies intentionally build products with short lifespans and intentionally lower the desirability of items over time. Its proof, that corporations are promoting and brainwashing us into throwaway culture and consumerism. It makes me angry to see so many people, including myself, blindly following the idea of consumerism despite its terrible effects on us. The anger is directed at the corporations, not the consumers. For the most part, consumers don’t know any better, whereas the corporations do, and should be forced to act ethically. In my opinion, incorporating fast fashion and consumerism into a business plan is completely unethical; it's a corporation manipulating its consumers. We need to start spreading awareness on this topic and force a change to happen.

I agree with your statement about “The Waste Makers” and how the attitude of how corporations make their products has changed in recent years. Nowadays corporations such as Apple and Microsoft only really care about selling as much of their product as many times as they can to the same consumers. They also attempt to sell “new” products to their consumers saying that they are a “upgraded” version. I feel a good example to this practice is what Apple did a few years ago with their iphone x. In 2017, Apple released their iphone x which already was not much of an upgrade from the iphone 9 and the x cost about $1000. Then in 2018, Apple released a “new” phone called the iphone xs which came with upgrades such as “slightly more water-proofed” and “more colors” and this phone also cost about $1000. Now I’m no expert on phones but selling an “upgrade” that is stated as being “slightly more water-proofed” does not seem like a very good thing to advertise about a phone and yet Apple still sold thousands of the “upgrade”. I feel the biggest issue is that corporations know that they can get away with these practices because they have been doing them for years. I think that the only way that we can get these corporations to stop these practices is to just stop buying them. Until then, more and more of these “new” products will be sold and then thrown away quickly, which will just hurt the planet more.



<br><hr>

Just like what you said, there are so many people who are following or even chasing after the fast-evolved technology. However,  people are actually “driven” to buy the newest version of iPhone, because, in order for the company to sell more product than they are supposed to be, they do not do their best to make the phones to last longer, but make them badly within period of time just as the new version came out. Just like the fast fashion in the other video, people are driven to by the most trendy clothes, so that they do not have to wear the same clothes twice. I know it is a little dramatic, but the truth is that social media and advertisement play huge roles in our lives, in addition to the low-quality products the company produced. When this becomes a way of marketing, the more people are going to be influenced. However, even if there are more people knowing this situation, the company does not change the way they produce things, people are still going to be driven to buy the newest version of whatever they need. And as a consumer, I wish that we could do something to help with the fast-pace of that.

I really liked this comment, because I thought it was very accurate and a bit funny. I also thought that the American economy was consumer driven and that is how it had always been. I think the iPhone example you used was spot on. I too have become apart of this consumer culture without even second guessing or realizing it. I currently have the iPhone X and even though it works perfectly fine, I still see myself waiting to get a new one. It actually sounds ridicilous as I type it out, but that is most of our realties. Not only with iPhones but with clothes, cars, etc. I thought this reading was very interesting and I was shocked to see how relevant it is today, even though it was written so long ago.

I read Huxley’s Brave New World a few years ago and although I think I understood the message from the book, I did not necessarily apply it to what is going on around us right now. It seemed to me like a warning of what could happen if mass consumerism takes over and people act on impulse, but after reading these chapters, I see how the book should now be taken as less of a warning for the future and more of a cry for help for the present. 
      <br><br>

In Huxley’s book, it was used by the government to keep control over the public, but in our real life, consumerism is used to literally control and run our economy. The argument that mass consumerism is necessary to keep our economy thriving is extremely unfortunate, yet true. This quote summed it up best: “It is absolutely necessary that the products that roll from the assembly lines of mass production be consumed at an equally rapid rate.” That is just the way that our country runs and thrives. It dates back many, many years as we hear Eisenhower say that the best way to make the recession recede is to buy ANYTHING. As long as our money keeps going back into the pot, it will keep the economy going and come back around. In order to ensure this, companies have become scary good at strategically appealing to consumers in any way possible to get them to purchase their products. For example, after Eisenhower’s comment a commercial claimed it to be their “patriotic duty” to buy more, and potato peelers are made in a neutral color in hopes of them getting thrown away and needing to be replaced. The norm now is to own multiples of the same product, like sunglasses, even though you would never wear more than one at a time, therefore do not need two, let alone five. Although owning an excess does not seem weird to me because that is what I am used to, I realize now that companies intentionally made this the norm years ago and successfully changed our standards.
      <br><br>

Companies try to give people “plausible excuses for buying more.” Our job as consumers now is to see through that and not purchase unless there is a plausible REASON to buy more. If ⅖ of our belongings are unnecessary, luxury items, we really should be rethinking our habits and the effects that they are having on our environment. After all, the economy surviving won’t matter if our planet cannot survive itself first.

Brave New World is actually my favorite book, and I was not surprised to see it used here! I had never related it myself, but the theme of innovation going too far and personal authenticity being lost is something I can definitely see in American society. I didn't realize that rapid consumerism was marketed as a way to save the economy, and while I guess it does create jobs, it also makes a lot of Americans spend their money for no reason. This is frustrating, because turning to not spending would put a lot of people out a job, and maybe it would stall the economy, but I feel like it could have been avoided by just investing in government bonds, as suggested by everyone but Eisenhower. Why didn't we just do that????
      <br><br>


The avid consumerism that is seen in dystopian novels such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451 is not very far off from us, and while they warned us from decades ago about technology and its effects. They wrote about how just because we could doesn't mean we should, and I saw a lot of that in this article. When the article started talking about toasters with nine different shades, and fridges with more buttons and knobs than we could count, I just thought back to those books. Our innovation is hurting us, and things like "Planned Obselence" are just ways to trick people into spending money. I started to wonder why we would fall for this, I mean, surely, there was something else that drew us into spending and constantly creating waste for landfills. But it was nothing, there was nothing there. We, truly, as Americans, were taught to waste with no second thought. It opened my eyes that a lot of the things we see as a necessity, such as separate deodorants, cars, phones, etc. are actually just consumerist ideas put into our heads to try and make more money for corporations. Great. 

      <br><br>

I feel like a lot of what we learned as kids is false, like that most things need to be refrigerated, that a car is a symbol of independence, that cow milk is good for you, these were all marketing schemes that we fell for without question, and that have fueled various corrupt industries. Its hard to unlearn all of this, and to see these normalities shattered before your eyes. But I think we all need to have a lot of these ideals ruined for us, in order to make change and see what are actions are actually doing to the environment. I cannot imagine the amount of waste that accumulates from these "disposable" products. I want to start buying more sustainable items, so I can contribute less to these shameful businesses.

Vance Packard's "The Waste Makers" told me information that I essentially already knew; it still upset me nonetheless. The worst thing that he talked about was planned obsolescence. I understand why the US economy (especially during wartime) advertised products heavily and tried to get people to buy stuff. It makes total sense that we would want to stimulate our economy, therefore increasing the American spirit and country unity. What I don't understand is planned obsolescence. It just seems so backwards. Obviously I understand this is a tactic used by corporations to sell more and more, but it just shocks me how greedy this really is. Planned obsolescence has entirely taken over our modern culture. There are no longer common shoe repair stores and furniture repair stores. Instead, you can just buy yourself a new pair of shoes or a new table... and for cheap! It no longer makes sense to repair items because it often costs more to repair than to just buy a new item.

One particular case of planned obsolescence that I heard about was with ink cartridges. It is common for these ink cartridges to come with electronics in it which, essentially, shut the cartridge off and allow it to no longer work, despite there still being ink in them. This case was disgusting to me because, not only has the market shifted towards disposable, single-use ink cartridges, but they are also manufacturing them in a way that keeps consumers buying them faster and faster. The fact that planned obsolescence was highlighted by Packard in the 1950s goes to show how deeply imbedded it is in our society.

The idea of planned obsolescence, especially obsolescence of quality, definitely angers me.  The things that companies will do for profit have no bounds.  In order to keep getting money from consumers, they are purposefully shortening the lifespan of products.  Because these products break more easily, much more waste is created.  I’ve noticed this in my personal life too.  When I was younger, I always used skull candy earbuds.  After a while, I realized that my earbuds would always break after 1-2 months of use.  There is no reason that such a large company should sell an easily broken product.  I’ve also noticed that my ink cartridges are always “running low” or “empty”.  I remember reading an article online, awhile back, about a company selling refillable printer ink cartridges, which would eliminate a lot of waste.  However, later on, I heard about how some printers were made so that only cartridges made by its company were usable.  Planned obsolescence is a concept that harms consumers and the environment.

Corporations are already capitalizing off of our needs, why should they be able to create need too? This is essentially the idea behind planned obsolescence; we need something, they create a product that fills that need but only temporarily, pulling into this cycle of needing products that will only cease to work soon after we purchase them. All of the examples you gave are great ones of this idea of planned obsolescence, which, in all honesty, may drive profit but directly negatively effects many people through selling them shit products, as well as indirectly through the environmental impact of all this.

Like many others in this class I’m a culprit of planned obsolescence in the best example of the iphone. The waste makers lays out there are three types of planned obsolescence and in conjunction with consumerism these create the vicious cycle that most Americans are stuck in. We continue to buy and buy and buy. We buy so much ‘stuff’ that is completely non-essential to living! Not only do we buy in excess amounts, but we buy and throw out because the style is not in trend or the newest iphone has three cameras instead of one. It’s not as simple as humans are greedy...we have been trained by society to feel this need to consume more and want more than we already have. A new car. A bigger house. Cooler clothes. We have been taught to think these are the things we must have to be happy. It makes me really sad because I know that I think this way as well. And for the U.S. specifically after our country became industrialized we never stopped. Yes, at the beginning of developing a country it is good to pump lots of technology and innovations out into society, but we’ve passed that point so far it's almost irreversible. One family doesn’t need more than one car, and that car should be built to last almost a lifetime, not be built and phased out in less than a year. Another way to look at waste control other than just simply consuming less is to recycle, but not everything can be recycled. If the majority of these products are made with planned obsolescence in mind they won’t be functioning long enough for us to reduce waste and reuse and recycle them. Something I learned in my ES2 class that can be applied here is the idea of ‘sustainable development’, which is defined as development that, “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” When what the U.S. is doing right now with fast fashion and food waste is the complete opposite. We have way too much right now and the planet will be destroyed and basically full of garbage very soon.

It isn't so surprising that our consumption has come to such an extreme. Anytime something becomes undesirable, throw it away and buy a new one. This goes for everything. with disgusting effect. New clothes, new car, new house, new everything. This is only accelerated by the rate which items become undesirable, which is more frequent as media makes everyone believe they have to have the newest toys right away. Corporations and advertisements run people's lives, so people do not even realize what they are buying anymore before they realize they are only buying everything just to feel like they belong. 
      <br><br>


Americans used to value and cherish their belongings, now they regard things only as temporary until they can afford to buy the next version or the next style. This is killing our planet as resources and our atmosphere can not keep up. I had no idea that corporations deliberately make the quality of their product worse just so people will buy more. I suppose I could have assumed but all the same it is a despicable thing when the ramifications kill our home

I think this book is relatable because I am a sneakerhead. I love buying shoes, even though some of them I barely wear after I bought them. Every time when fancy shoes or limited edition shoes come out, I go crazy. I do not need them, I just want to follow the trend. Sometimes I know it is pathetic, but I just can’t help. I guess that what materialism is. Fashion industries keeps designing all kinds styles of shoes, but in all, they are just shoes. Even though we all know about this fact, we can still resist. I only knew it is a waste of money until I read this book. It is not only a waste of money, but also a threaten to our world. Buying more than we need will lead to over production, and over production will eventually cause wasting. Wasting is bad and we all know that. I think this book does warm me and many others just like me to rethink before buying. Do we really need that?

Vance Packard discusses how citizens have to consume more of the products being manufactured in order to keep the economy. This makes me think of the great depression and it scares me. If we buy too many products we are harming the Earth. Yet if we do not buy these products it could affect the economy. There is no balance. 
      <br><br>

     Something else he said captured my attention. If most Americans (consumers) already have your product in their home, what do you do as a producer to not run out of business? You create a “new and improved” product. Most of the time the product works the same as the one you own yet the new one just looks a little different. It is also advertised in a way that makes you want to buy it. Sound familiar? Companies such as Apple are doing this and we continue to fall for these tricks. We buy new phones that  function the same as the one you already own but simply because it is a different color and size we want it. The market is in a way to make it look “new.” Apple is not the only company doing this. That is where these abundance of items rtakes place.

The book mentioned how production and consumption are needed in order to keep the growth of the economy : we cannot produce nothing at all but we can’t produce too much which there is an excess surplus and no one is buying the products. It is true that it is hard to keep a balance. But reading the book and knowing it says how the economy and the market in order to survive, they are creating those ideas to consumers that we all need to buy stuff and buy as much as we want and as much as the market can supply. This idea is terrible in fact, because we are trying to improve our economy/make profit , while at the sametime even we know we don’t need that much of things and we don't want to buy it, we are being forced to have the idea we have to consume those things that are ready in the market. The horrifying outcome we get from it is all these waste produced. There are just way too many things we haven't used at all or use it for too many times; things are just getting outdated,etc,and we are now being forced to buy all those things again. I think this is a huge problem here with our society and economy and the crisis put on our environment. We should really start to reconsider the pattern of production and consumption we now have. Can we find a way to relieve the problem and to save our planet? I think there are ways for us to do that but only depends on how we can correctly manipulate it. To keep our economy and at the same time protecting the planet we all live in.

The Waste Makers by Vance Packard proved to be an expository piece pointing out the manipulative habits of manufacturing companies that have been perpetuating the consumer industry for years. I believe that the majority of the foundation of the consumer industry has been fabricated by manufacturing companies who want to ensure that their businesses will continue to prosper. Since the years after the war, manufacturers have understood that our economy is dependent on keeping consumption high. Now that the consumer market has been saturated with goods, it’s made it significantly more difficult for products to sell, because most homes are already own the goods that they need. Due to this, sellers have come up with many strategies that have proven to keep consumers coming back, despite there not being a pressing need to buy more. These strategies have allowed the industry to prosper and remain a large force in propelling our economy.  
      <br><br>
 This book truly exposed how manipulative the manufacturing and advertising industry is. When Packard went into detail about the concept of obsolescence and the three different types of it, I felt as if I was powerless as a consumer. Reading how companies will use obsolescence of quality and purposefully design their goods to give out at a certain point in order for that customer to have to come back, made me feel deceived. But then again, that is their whole intent, isn’t it? Manufacturers only selfishly consider their own gain, without thinking about the damage it could do to the consumer, in terms of financials, and more importantly our planet. Their desire to make sure that the public is willing to consume more and in greater amounts than the years prior has led to a complete attitude of disregard for the environmental impact. In the reading, it talked about how meals began being sold in single-use, throw-away containers that were convenient and easy for busy families to buy and eat. This design also ensured that families would need to continue buying their products since their meals were only single use. This leads to enormous amounts of waste, and not to mention how costly it can become for the consumer. So, while the advertising of single meals might make it seem like a brilliant new idea, it’s actually just hiding its negative drawbacks. One statistic Packard provides is that the average American family spends nearly $500 a year on just simply the packaging of a product. This exemplifies just how wasteful the consumer industry is.
       <br><br>
Packard also mentions that sometimes the consumer doesn’t choose to waste things, but rather is forced to waste. An example given was with lipsticks and how the design of the product doesn’t physically allow the user to completely utilize all the contents in the lipstick. Instead, the user is forced to throw out their almost empty lipstick container and replace it with another. This design is done purposefully by manufacturers in order to get the consumer coming back sooner and more often. By just making that small last amount unusable, it accelerates the time table that the buyer will need to purchase a new one. This is yet just another trick that the manufacturing industry utilizes in order to force consumerism.

This reading illustrates why Americans become avid consumers in the decades. Interestingly, the whole reading’s these are all the same as what I am learning in this quarter. As a student who changed the major from Environmental studies to the pre-econ. I am just sick of the passive consequence in every example that the professors show in every individual lecture. The acid rain that caused but the carbon dioxide that most produced from people’s productions and simple living. The natural extinction in the African rainforest caused by people as well. As long as peoples are existing on the earth, what they are doing for the most is just consumption and consume natural resource.
       <br><br>

All of the examples show how marketing manipulate the economy and the consumers’ mind. Thus, if I want to save the environment to let it develop positively the only way is not to learn the consequence of any natural examples or any environmental disasters. From my perspective is to learn marketing and how the economy works deeply. Therefore, in the future, I could, even just a tiny influence. But to protect the environment and leading the consumers and marketing in a positive and environmentally friendly way.

“There are more passenger cars in the land than there are families” (Packard, Waste Makers). Maybe what we need is more families. 
       <br><br>
I have been thinking about this whilst reading Waste Makers and I believe it’s relevant to the cultural change paradigm of limiting the climate crisis. When I say “more families”, I don’t mean “more people”, I mean “less single people”. The issue with skyrocketing divorce rates, lower rates of marriage, higher rates of individuals leading single lives, is actually a dual issue.
       <br><br>
The first issue comes from the doubling of goods. If Richard divorces Cosima, then Richard will have to buy all goods he previously owned but cannot use because of the divorce. Alternatively, if Richard had neve met Cosima, and if society becomes hostile to the forming of relationships and nuclear families, then Richard might live by himself, not sharing the goods that he owns. 
       <br><br>
The second issue is more subjective. Nuclear families are a proven model for stable happy lives. Consumerism is often the escape of the unhappy, of those who live without tight human bonds. The destruction of nuclear families in modern society is excellent news for large consumer corporations; it means more unhappy, single individuals. The latter means consumers with higher perceived marginal utility. If waste and over-consumption is truly an issue (and it is), then today’s cult of individuality is problematic.

       <br><br>
Packard writes about the role of the government in facilitating consumerism. This is quite pertinent and even critical. Western governments are obsessed with “protecting the consumer”. This strange obsession can easily be seen with the Central European Bank, for example. In the midst of an economic slowdown in Europe, the CEB commenced a  plan of quantitative easing. QE is a practice in macroeconomics / monetary-economics which consists in injecting massive amounts of liquidity into the economy in order to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lowered, consumers can more easily borrow money in order to finance their material desires. Technically, it helps mostly corporations, as they also benefit from lower interest rates in order to invest continuously.
       <br><br>

But it isn’t merely low interest rates. Some countries in the EU have negative interest rates. Yes: you gain money from borrowing. As absurd as it may sound, it clearly shows the motivations of politicians and our democracies: to encourage consumption and thus, growth. The obvious setback of this system is more carbon emissions (self-explanatory in the context of the course). If cultural change matters, then maybe one change would involve shifting political culture from consumer friendly to human friendly (whatever that means).

I loved your view on needing more families in the world as I never thought about the book in such a way. It really opened my views to see just how much we actually own and how we do not need much of it. Whether they be single or divorced, I've noticed many people who own about 2 or 3 cars whilst living by themselves. That is absolutely crazy. Each car prob holds little marginal utility towards the owner as they are simply collecting out of want instead of actual need. They want that new sports car but they absolutely don't need it. I think this relates back to the culture we have established as celebrities flex their brand new amazing cars all over social media. Celebrities own tons of cars and I think that this image has skewed the American public to chase this dream which in reality only hurts their freedom as they become strapped in debt. Our car culture in America needs to change and it needs to become "cool" to utilize mass transit and bikes to save our earth.


<br><hr>
Less single people certainly is an interesting take on reducing waste; creating more families inevitably results in the sharing of resources, goods, services, housing transport, or otherwise, “stuff”. I believe you’re on the right track, though I wonder if humanity can take it a step further. What we need are communities. By this I mean tight-knit, trusting, village-like communities. As described in the short film about the introduction of a new economic system called a “plentitude economy”, neighbors and community members come to trust and rely on each other not only for comradery, but also the sharing and borrowing of stuff. Additionally, involved, tight-knit communities are more likely to engage in shared projects, such as community gardens, garage sales, or carpooling. More people sharing the same stuff means less buying new things, sharing stuff, and subsequently reducing waste.
       <br><br>

In response to “The Waste Makers”, what I found most disturbing is the idea of planned obsolescence of products and desirability. The things we buy are designed to fall apart – in just enough time for us to deem it a necessary and viable product - inducing us to buy it again and again. If the product doesn’t break in time for the manufacturing company to make a profit, they convince you it is out of style, socially undesirable, which induces us to purchase the slightly updated version of the same shitty product we bought in the first place. The simple fact is, as Ken mentioned, corporations often put lining their pockets above the needs of real living beings.
       <br><br>

Who is to blame for all this senseless consumption? Is it the blind consumer, buying unnecessarily and fueling the industrial mechanisms that are poisoning the planet? Is it the industries, who inundate our lives with advertisements and new shiny products, essentially forcing us to buy and keep buying? Is it the government, for failing to regulate the industries on their waste output and instead caters to big businesses’ needs while also encouraging the public to buy in order to keep the economy moving upwards? I think it’s all of our faults. There is much work to be done by everyone in this system; we all play a role, granted some larger than others, and must realize this problem isn’t about who is to blame, rather about how to begin changing. You can start with you, today.
       <br><br>

This linear design of consumption and stuff is unsustainable on a planet that operates in cycles. We extract, manufacture, distribute, consume, and throw away, though there is no connection. All the waste we produce in every step is one of the many cancers the Earth has contracted. We need a cyclic model of goods as described in Annie Leonard’s “The Story of Stuff”.

In the reading, I learned how as the years go on, people are starting to consume more things than they actually need. In the reading I learned that nearly all things are not essential to them. It is sad for people to constantly spend money on things that they don’t need, and they can spend it on other corporations to help save the planet and clean the environment. People mostly focus on luxury things and the influence to these are two main factors. One factor is the the expansion of the product force and the second one is the expansion of the industries. This distinguishes the main reason why the rise of consumerism is in place. If there were less industries, people would have less clothes and unnecessary things. I feel like I fall into this category because I purchase things that I don’t really need. This encourages me and challenges me to stop buying unnecessary things and clothes. When I was reading, it was interesting how people are more interested in the newer things instead of the older things. This causes more people to purchase more things and causes the industries to continue to function and maintain themselves since they have a lot of consumers. I feel like a good analogy would be tequila and wine, the older it is the richer it tastes. I feel we can use this as an example that we should focus more on the older stuff and it would reduce the customers /consumers purchase on the things. This would make the industries go out of business leading to less gases going to the atmosphere.

I liked your analogy! I agree that the more that we spend, and the more that we support the industry, the worse that this issue is going to get. Why would they stop producing items and taking our money if it is working? We need to repent against consumerism, in order to decrease the progression of these industries and companies. With no demand there will be no need for supply, and eventually-hopefully-we will be able to reduce consumerism so greatly that people will learn that it is not a negative thing to have less. We should look at other countries and cultures for proof of this; the majority of countries around the world have far far less than we do, specifically referring to material items, yet they tend to be a lot happier. Why does no one question this? We need to learn to take their examples and set them for ourselves, in order to create happier lives and a happier world. And, of course, a healthier, happier climate.

The Wayback Machine portals today’s readers into the pioneer days of consumerism. The foundations behind this are derived from feeding the American economy. In the times after the Great Depression, it made sense to promote spending because it would lead the American people out of tough times. However, this mindset has intensified throughout the decades, rising consumption is occurring now in an unrealistic fashion for our society, let alone our planet. “Some marketing experts have been announcing that the average citizen will have to step up his buying by nearly 50 per cent in the next dozen years, or the economy will sicken.” This quote really spoke to me because, if the intense consumption isn't benefiting our economy, then what good is it for? Certainly not the consumers, who have been brainwashed and manipulated into believing that more is better. And it’s certainly not benefiting businesses, who have forgotten what quality is and evolved into ravenous, exploiting marketers as an attempt to stay relevant and continue profits. Industries are reaching full creativity as consumers rush to buy their social acceptance. Innovation and expansion aren’t always relevant, but some companies have no other choice if they want to keep their jobs. Mindless consumption has become so normalized in America that any alternative seems impossible to achieve, despite the moral integrity being called to question and the fact that many other countries have no problem retaining quality. This week’s reading clearly confirms that the supply and demand relationship in America has turned into a toxic one.

After reading "The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, a sense of fear arise in my heart since our consumption is actually manipulate purposely and delicately by the producers. When we have already adapted to the existence of something, it will hard for us to question the rationality. For the young generation, who is the majority to pursue the fashion, it’s easy to be the target of advertisement. For instance, in the smart phone industry, each brand commonly launches 2 new version within a year. I have seen so many people replace their phone by a new iPhone when the old one is still fictional.  “Major advances in existing appliances and introduction of completely new appliances cannot be expected for at least several years”. I found a problem that people are too extreme. On the one side when meet a recession, the only thing people care about is stimulating the economy through the consumption. On the other side, some environmentalist will come out and point out that their decision is harmful for environment. The case that producer is maximizing their profit while caring about the environment is rarely seen. The growth of economy is important since it partially relates to standard of life, but stimulate people to consume much more than they need is inadvisable.

I agree with you a lot. "The Waste Makers" is an extraordinary read for me, and it shocked me. Fast fashion is a big topic nowadays. Most youngsters are "addicted" to the new trends, they simply buy and discard in a significant high frequency. The advertisements always contain some unreal elements that promote consumers to buy the products continuously. For example, the automobile is a gigantic industry and people can either buy or lease one. Leasing is often 36 months, and some people change a car after the leasing is terminated. 
       <br><br>

Do those people who buy the car will keep the car any longer? Probably not! The automobile technology advances every year. Those big car companies, like BMW, MB, and Audi, push new cars every SINGLE year. And by comparing two same model cars in two years, it is easy to identify the big differences. Headlights, displays, wheels, etc.. get more fashionable. Therefore, fast fashion is not just clothes, it includes automobile and even other industries. This is a systematic problem that needs to be fixed AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. More promotion needs to be given to the consumers who would use a car for a longer period. Carbon taxes need to be collected for those changing cars every three years.

<p>
The Waste Makers talks about people consuming much more products than decades ago. However, people are not buying things that are necessary for their daily life, instead they are spending more money to buy optional or luxury products. With the endless rising of consumptions, the efficiency of production also increases that people are having more technologies and machines to help with the production in order to support the demand. Each industry is facing the problem to stimulate greater desire and to create new wants, and it is harder each year to attract people’s attention since there are millions of new products coming out every year. 
        <br><br>

Big companies are producing goods and causing environmental issues like pollution and global warming, but at the same time because of the strong demand from the people, they have to make those products in order to survive in the market. I think people need to work on the problems from both sides. There should be higher standards and more regulations on the companies about the things they can do in order to protect the Earth, and normal people as the consumers should demand less optional or luxury products.

“The Makers of Waste” was a very interesting read. As Ken mentions in the video, we live in a consumerism society that was nothing like it is today, but has turned into our “new normal” society because we are not part of the generations in which consumerism emerged. Moreover, I was a little intrigued to know about the origin of the business mechanism and the author Vance Packard does a good job at explaining in a series of sections the beginning of the consumerism era. 
        <br><br>


I can’t imagine a society in which people had just what they needed, though hard to believe that is how it seems it was. While reading, I was amused to learn the different ways in which companies elaborate to influence people into buying goods. Although I had little knowledge about the death date of electronics, I never thought about the implications behind it. It stuck with me when the author mentions that engineers are being hired to be destroyers of their own creativity ! From all three types of obsolescence, planned obsolescence by desirability, also known as psychological obsolescence, made me realize how heavy we rely on stereotypes and consumption. They know exactly what to do for us to replace our belongings for new updated versions that might have just changed its looks, rather than its functioning.

Packard clearly outlined the truth behind big corporations and how they can manipulate us. It was interesting to learn how corporations try to sell more to increase their profits by not actually progressing the functions of their products. This objective view of consumerism and the science behind it paints greed almost as a disease. Once these companies knew how impactful reproduction and speed was to their income, they've been amping it up since. One man high up in an appliance company stated that he didn't care about creating better functioning machinery anymore, just make newer ones that are pretty. Consumers are easily tricked into these schemes, believing that their money is going towards something greater, something better than their neighbor, etc. The greed then spreads to them. 
        <br><br>
This has been the process that's taken over our society nearly in a century. Success is measured by what you own in America. These companies are tricking us, telling us how we will be fulfilled with their products. What we really need are functional, long-lasting items, but we've been trained to think otherwise. Now we are surrounded by waste, trapped in a unfulfilling state of mind, and surrounded by ads bringing us back to greed.
<br><hr>

 I agree with the statement that a person's worth is determined by their material items here in America. The fact that the marketing companies and industries are consciously exploiting this concept is upsetting in and of itself. The power that the marketing and sales people have over the consumers of our dangerous consumer culture is concerning. These companies are profit hungry and will do anything to have consumers buying more and more useless things every year. After reading this, I have become not only frustrated, but also ashamed in the way that consumer culture has affected us. Your statement about how companies are making goods that look prettier instead function better is accurate. There are many items that seem to be an upgrade from the last model, but are just more aesthetically pleasing and not any more functional. In some cases, the functionality may be even worse than the last model in order to promote repurchasing, thus leading to more profit. These material items are taking over the happiness of our lives, making us minions in the marketing and sales industry.

I also think The Waste Makers was a very informative read and found it interesting to learn about the history of the American consumerism society. While reading, I could see how the enormous amount of production, influence to buy, and focus on materialistic tendencies caused American products to become bigger; many foreigners tend to agree that the size of the roads, fast food drinks, houses, everything in American is bigger. And when comparing the pre-1950s to the current capitalist society, it’s quite unbelievable the direction our society took. For example, I find it ironic how Say’s Law, the concept that “people will automatically consume eagerly everything that their nation’s economy can turn out for them, was thought of during an era of scarcity, but the same eagerness to consume is promoted during an era of abundance (22). It almost seems counterintuitive. When Ken poses who is responsible for our obsession with consumer stuff, I think the blame should go on the big corporations and advertisers who choose what messages to communicate to the public, and not the consumers ourselves. The grand messages spread to an entire mass control the way people think whether we like it or not.



<br><hr>
I also think that “The Waste Makers” was an interesting book to read. Vance Packard shared how bigger corporations targeted consumers and turned them into wasteful people by convincing them they needed to have the latest version of their product. These corporations don’t care about the consequences of their actions as long as their profits continue to grow. I’m sure that we can all relate to buying things that we don’t need just because we are trying to keep up with the trends. For example, I currently have an iPhone 8 and really want the iPhone 11, but I realize I don’t need it. My current phone works just fine and is in perfect condition since I take really good care of my belongings. Ken brings up the question of who is responsible for the over consuming: us consumers or the companies? I think that it is both since companies are the ones who convince us that we need to consume more, but it is also our own fault for falling victim to their money making schemes. We as the consumer have the power to decide what becomes the new trend, but we are letting ourselves be manipulated by these larger companies.

I was surprised by how wasteful our society is. The Waste Makers effectively convey their message to help their audience, the American people, how wasteful we truly are. By referring to how items were cherished in the past really puts in perspective how much consumer culture has warped the views of people. The quote, “Residents of the United States were discarding, using up, destroying, and wasting products at a rate that offered considerable encouragement to those charged with achieving ever higher levels of consumption…” shows how the culture is gaining in power and popularity throughout the history of America. The companies behind the promotion of this are profiting off of the ignorant mindset of the public and the well being of the planet. It is shocking to read about the extent that people from other places in the world view the wastefulness of Americans. The article made me reflect on my own habit, and realizing that I could change in a way to lower my carbon footprint. I feel like the idea of recycling is taken in the wrong way; it sort of encourages people to not feel guilt about throwing out disposable as opposed to buying them sparingly in the first place.

"Waste Makers" goes deep into corporate America to uncover the different tactics that corporations use to draw consumers to purchase their products and as a result negatively effect the environment. So far this has been my favorite reading of the course. I really enjoyed the economic history of how America became such a consumer powerhouse. The idea that America is a "war machine" is a topic often touched on, the idea that America's economy thrives only due to America always being in a war or in a potential state of war. This only makes sense as there are so many moving parts of the economy that supply military goods, and even more so the military-industrial complex is dominated by only a few big name suppliers. A big supply used in war is oil for mobilization of units, this also happens to be one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions into the atmosphere, along with the ill effects it has on our oceans. "Waste Makers" describes that because our economy is so reliant on our military that when money is retracted from defense spending the overall economy and stock market takes a dip. Along with this "Waste Makers" also shows how consumer tastes changed over time, or I should say how producers influenced consumers to change their taste. The article mentions that certain industries reached their peak, for technological innovation the home appliance industry for example,  and started to sell less products. Therefore they had to come up with clever ways to sell consumers products they already owned, and as a result we have ended up in an America where consumers constantly have a surplus of goods. Overall I found "Waste Makers" to be very insightful in showing how America evolved into the corporate juggernaut that it is today.

As you stated, “Waste Makers” was definitely very insightful. I also found it interesting to read about the way in which consumerism started to become noticeable during the 50s. Even in the beginning we see the way in which Packard started the second chapter by quoting Eisenhower. He included that Eisenhower’s solution to the recession was to “buy anything”. When I read this, I was like really?! He stated it was a patriotic duty to buy and consume more to help the economy. Packard also includes the fact that during the recession, “soft goods” arose, which includes food, clothing, tobacco, and drugs.  
        <br><br>
Further into the reading, Packard includes that the average American spent $500 on packaging every year (im assuming it has gone up more than that). Throughout the chapters he would mention things that have become such a part of society now a days, and the concept of consumers given millions of excuses and dumb reasons to buy stuff. For instance, one of the things that caught my attention was the “double-ring” ceremony in which it became popularized for the couple getting married to both have rings. Other things that were crazy to hear was the way things are packaged, and how much product is left in there when the packaging has stopped product from being released like the aerosol cans.

“The Waste Makers” has made is quite evident to me that waste is incredibly necessary to maintain a booming economy. We need to be able to throw things away to buy more, and marketing must produce goods that we’ll want to throw away. The tactics delineated in the chapters we read align with modern consumerism so precisely, and given the date of the reading, it is remarkable to learn of EXACTLY how we have arrived where we are today. Overflowing with examples of ways that consumers are manipulated by business folk, I finished the reading as a proud “shopping hater”. I don’t like new things; I like keeping and reusing things as much as possible (think of how much money saved). I have a lot of old clothes (I have been wearing most of my same clothing since I was 13). I have an old car, old furniture, and am working to reject the necessity for new devices. I found it interesting that the phrasing the author used was that fashion is made to look ugly… How true! How many times have I put on something I used to like and hated it! However, since I keep my clothes and rarely add new ones, I have watched some items go from “cute”, to “ugly”, and back to “cute” again. It’s stupid, and I work hard to ignore controlling trends and focus on what looks good on me. Yet I watch the majority of people around me throw things away and refill their wardrobe regularly. IV trading post here on campus promotes a healthy way to continue this process, by genuinely recycling clothing given away, and allowing for a wardrobe refill to come from a sustainable source. But it is still confirming the necessities to rid one’s self of old and fill oneself with new, which allows the unhealthy commitment to consumerism to continue.

Continuing the discussion of excessive disposables, let’s talk about vapes. First, Ken brings up the Mickey Mouse of cigarettes: Camel. Marketing to children to create a new generation of smokers, despite the science showing black lungs and DEAD people. Marketers are killing people, companies are killing the planet… cool theme, check that out econ majors! Fast-forward to our new generation where cigarettes are disgusting (“unless you’re drunk”, as you might hear a lot of students claim), but these nifty little electronic smoke machines are the cat’s meow. The colorful “Puff” devices, in particular, must offer around 15 flavors to nicotine enthusiasts and can be tossed out as soon as they’re dead, so you have the chance to try out each kind, as if they’re a chemical filled lollipop. Naturally, there is little hesitancy to jump onto this bandwagon since they taste so darn good… But we as students are children, and this marketing is simply creating a new generation of nicotine addicts. I spent the weekend with a “business professional” a week ago. Our socialization consisted of his work as a team manager for a successful company, and his favorite nicotine flavors. Those aren’t social skills, and I was astonished to hear how enthusiastic he was about these nicotine filled pieces of plastic, that last a day. A pack of cigarettes is more environmentally friendly, and cheaper. Bring back the camels.

I have to be honest, I just started getting into style this year by getting all of these new clothes. I have gotten new bomber jackets and denim jackets which is okay because they can go over my old T-shirts. My main problem is my pants. I mean some of them I could not wear because they have become too big on me,. But I realize how many pants I actually had. At home, I have 15 pairs of blue jeans. I should really just have like 3 pairs of blue jeans. But also since I came to college I learned more about the style which I found that you cannot wear blue jeans all the time. So I end buying black, riped, even white pants. So I agree, style makes it so if you don't have the best clothes and not have a variety of different clothes
        <br><br>


I mean I am an econ major and I do see this as a problem. Since being in this class, I did not know that business thinks of these awful ideas. I mean business is trying to make kids smoke because they want to get as much money as possible which is very stupid.  I feel that if I ever have control, I would want to change the ways the business thinks. I want to make people happy by producing products that can change the world in a positive way, not a negative way.


<br><hr>
Although I don't necessarily agree with your statement that we should "bring back the camels" (let's just stop putting crap in our lungs altogether maybe), I though you made a great connection between the advertising tactics of cigarette companies back in the 80's and the strategies being used by e-cigarette and vape companies today to target children and young consumers. As you stated, instead of a cartoon camel to lure children into a lifetime nicotine addiction, companies now infuse their products with irresistible flavors such as cotton candy and mango to make them more enticing to younger customers. You would think that after the lid blew off the whole cigarette situation that people would avoid any products that even resembled a cigarette, but I guess if you color it baby blue and make it taste like bubblegum no one cares!
        <br><br>
I also thought that it is a bit mind boggling that this was written ~60 years ago because it is still so relevant today. Packard wrote an entire chapter about "planned obsolescence" and how companies use this tactic to practically force consumers to have to continue buying the best, newest models because the ones they currently own don't work properly anymore, and this is an issue we still face today. For example, my family and I are always joking about how Apple perfectly times it so that right when a new iPhone is released, the model you own starts bugging out (even if you only bought it 2 years ago). Things like phones and cars are supposed to be durable goods, things that can last you a very long time. Unfortunately, companies that produce these "durable goods" would rather make crappy products that die every couple of years than actually do their job and make something that could run for a lifetime.

I do not know since when, the American mainstream culture and mainstream American dream become consumer culture. When buy things we do not need, we buy things that are still working. When buying a new product becomes a fashion just like the term still useable but now fashionable. It is so ironic that we forget the most essential ideas that the fundamental purpose of a cloth is to wear, not fashion. Just like phones, the fundamental purpose is we can use it, instead of the extra 10% faster cpu than the last generations. Think about that, do we really need that extra 10 % cpu, or the new fashion car of this season? What is more sad that companies purposefully design and make things that will break in a few years or even less just to make us buy the new one.It is funny that whenever the new iphone comes out, the Google search topic shows the searching of bad iphones increases. Apple also admits that whenever the new iphone comes out, they change some settings for consumers' exiting battery to make them less reliable and make people think they need to buy a new one. It is really coincidences that your phone feel less powerful when the new one comes out? It is psychologically designed by these companies. It is sad truth American is spending the money and buying things which they do not need now. They are using future money by credit card. This is extremely bad for the environment and economy.

Reading "The Waste Makers" was extremely informative and interesting, yet not particularly shocking - to me, at least. As somebody who has never lived in the United States before college, one of the first things that would always come to my mind when somebody mentioned the US was their consumerism. Vance Packard describes this perfectly in the first paragraph: "Visiting foreigners comment
        <br><br>
that the abundance of America seems to spill over into the aisles
        <br><br>
 of stores, spread along the highways, and bulge out the doors, windows, and attics of houses." Pretty much everything in America is bigger, more excessive, and more extreme. I remember the first time I entered an American supermarket - I thought that getting lost in a European one was bad, but I had no idea that a store could seem like a whole shopping mall. I was so bewildered by the abundance of products - coming in all shapes, sizes, colors, and styles. Whereas back home, you could choose between four to five different peanut butter brands in a typical supermarket, there is a whole aisle full of them in the US. I always wondered how anybody was able to choose what to buy. Now I understand that people don't really choose - they just buy as much as possible.

        <br><br>

Other things that were totally foreign to me when I first visited the United States: their huge portions in restaurants, extremely wide streets with giant cars and massive houses with way too much space to fill. It's almost like America is built on the belief that everything needs to be bigger and more. I was reminded of that while reading "The Waste Makers", and found myself agreeing with everything that Packard stated. Of course, I'm not going to act like excessive consumerism isn't a problem in Europe too - however, in the US it seems like everything always comes back to it. I am definitely guilty of buying unnecessary clothing items just because they are "trendy" right now, or begging my parents to get me the newest iPhone, simply because my old - but sufficient - version isn't "cool" anymore. I understand that it is hard not to partake in the consumerist culture, but the reason why this ideology is still prominent is that we let it. Think about how many companies would go out of business if we suddenly decided that we don't need four different types of sneakers or thirty different brands of cereal. We need to stop looking at products as disposable items and start focusing on how much work and effort it takes to create them. The reason why we are so negligent with our clothes, for example, is because we see the value behind them, we only see what they represent. 
        <br><br>
"The Waste Makers" is an excellent book that helps draw attention to the fact that our society and economy is based on consumerism and how we got to that point. What is important now, I believe, is where we go from here.

it is interesting to see things from an outsider's perspective and to see how dramatically different our consumer culture is even from other Western cultures like Europe. As someone who has never been to Europe, this is surprising to me because I always pictured European countries to be all about fashion and aesthetics. While I have lived in the US nearly my entire life, I have an interesting point of view because I was born and raised in Calexico, a border town to Mexico and I spent a great deal of my childhood in Mexico as well. The Northern city of Mexicali is very different from the US, although it has grown tremendously and has become highly consumerist as well, the poorest parts of the city live in extreme poverty - often sustaining themselves and their family by selling bubble gum and other products at the port of entry. It is a sad feeling every time I go to Mexicali and see the conditions that so many are living in, while I am living in extreme abundance in comparison. Reading the Waste Makers definitely made me see American culture in an entirely new perspective. Although I wasn't totally surprised reading about the ways that marketing companies manipulate consumers into purchasing their products, I never realized the extent that our lifestyles rely on advertisements. It honestly made me really frustrated to hear about all the tactics they used to manipulate people into buying things they don't need. I'm glad I got the chance to read the Waste Makers because it made me more conscious of the strategies being used and hopefully I will be more resistant to them in the future. I can only hope that the rest of Americans wake up as well, but judging by the way American society relies on advertisements, I don't feel very optimistic about seeing any dramatic changes that we need.

I had a similar experience with you. I am from China. Before I came to the US, I did not have an image about local life. When I arrived here, I found it was different from my home country. We do have a lot of shopping malls and stores in China, but they are never empty since China has a large population. In the US, I also can see many stores and the stores are very big, but sometimes, I see there are few people inside. For me, I enjoyed this in the US, since I have a better shopping experience and environment, but I was also wondering how these stores could make profit without customers. The sentence you cited is what I see from my personal experience. Also, as many environmentalists criticize, the US has a “wasting lifestyle.” But I also found that it is hard to change this situation, since no one would like to live in a place where there is only one store and restaurant. Although there might not be many people, these facilities should keep up. This reading is hard to change people’s lifestyle. It can only let people know they are a waste maker.

It was crazy to see that such a high fraction of the things we own were not essential to our wellbeing. It’s stated that only about ⅗ of what the average person owns is relevant and that the other ⅖ is optional. To imagine that we have so many things that we really don’t need and the fact that consumerism is steadily increasing just goes to show that in the future, we will be owning much more “optional” stuff. In the future, I would expect the ratio to be fifty fifty to what we actually need and what we don’t. As time goes on, people from all economic backgrounds are calling for more growth in the economy leading to wanting for more production and sales. This further leads to the consumer buying more things which would boost the economy, but litter the consumer’s home with things that may not be essential. In the 1960s, this growth was perceived so important that both political parties in the running pressed for more growth and they only argued through which methods should be implemented to induce this growth. Very interesting was the mention of Say’s Law which states that people will consume anything that the economy is churning out for them and that production equals distribution. This concept was made in a time when things were scarce and anything would go. I believe that this is still partially true today as people are always willing to buy things. An example would be the iphone. As soon as a new iphone were to be put out on the market, consumers would be standing in lines that stretch far and wide just to buy this new product. To some degree, Say’s Law is true, but not 100%. I believe that we have an inner feeling of wanting to buy things and that we are so enamored by the “improvements” that the companies are putting out. Because of this, whenever there is any slight variation on a product that people already like, they feel obligated to get it because it is “bigger and better”, but for the sake of our planet, living better isn’t the most optimal thing to do.

In the reading “The Waste Maker”, I noticed there is a “two-house parade”, which basically means a well equipped home should have two washers, two driers, or two refrigerators. However, as I know, especially for refrigerator, it will emit a really large number of greenhouse gases since it must keep working every moment. It is indeed more convenient to have two of these things at home, but it is not necessary. One is enough to support or bring convenience to a whole family. Also, another thing mentioned is that people usually have two or more pairs of glasses just because of style diversity. As we all know from previous reading, each product could produce an amount of greenhouse gases, and while people purchase more not because of necessity, more extra greenhouse gases will be emitted as well. One thing all of the people should be aware is that even if you are wealthy enough to purchase anything you want, you should be focused on those what you really need instead of what you really like. In this case, the productivity will be influenced as well. Thus, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted will reduce.

I definitely agree. In my own home, I have multiple refrigerators/freezers, although all of them are full, I will add that most of the food has been frozen for months, and could have not been purchased in the first place to have less food to be able to fit all of it in one refrigerator. It most definitely indirectly emits a lot of greenhouse gases as the electricity it uses is enormous. I think a lot of people are now buying things they need, want, and sometimes they buy things they don't even want, like some of my family. I think the more things one has, the more stress one has. In addition to saving the environment, a relatively minimalist lifestyle can reduce stress and improve quality of life.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, I noticed the same thing that he noticed and included in his book. While I do agree that fridges, among other common household appliances are responsible for a large amount of greenhouse emissions, I would like to refute that most homes that are considered equipped if they have two of everything. From personal experience, I have seen many families have 2 fridges, but not washers and dryers among others. One thing that stood out to me from this reading is that he mentions how corporations brought the need for desire that wasn't necessary, causing the consumer to think they needed something they really didn't. I feel as though we do need a change in the culture of our nation, but the only way that we can do that is though a bunch of small steps, not major radical steps that could polarize the public.

Companies are extremely good at telling the public they need more, this is seen in almost every aspect of our lives. They fill us with this propaganda portrayed by commercials, magazines, news, billboards, etc. Then they made it necessary to buy more, credit was introduced then people started spending more on more with money they did not have. Now look at what we live in now, most households boast a vehicle for every adult in the home as you see 2+ cars in every driveway. That's nearly 4+ tons of C02 added to the atmosphere every year from each household from cars alone. Let alone the fossil fuels burned to heat the home, cook food, provide power, and account for all the material things purchased within the home like electronics and clothing. In reading the Waste Maker it opened my eyes as to what goes into everything I own and heavily supports the idea of "simplify, simplify", we as humans have reached a point of grotesque consumption and it is nigh time to focus on efficiency and long term survival which starts with social change.

This book is interesting because it states some strategies that the companies use to persuade and convince their consumer to buy, such as the small thing- our smart phone. The companies would make some advertisements to show how perfect their products are which people would become obese to buy even though they do not need. Take our smart phone for example: Apple store comes up with new products every year. Although people do already have a smart phone; however, they still want to own the latest one. So I think people should become more calm down when buying things. We should only buy those things that we do necessarily need because if we buy too much products and give up using the old one, it would not be good for our environment.

After reading Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers,” I am not so surprised that the marketers and advertisers beguile the public into accepting false standards. Basically, this is their jobs and they do that for the money obviously. This book blames these distorted values on the business community. Since the advertisers are so good that a lot of people are convinced by their words to consume a lot more than they should. People are also harmed by their consumption. Indeed, we people consumed so much more products that we really do not need. And in most cases, we are only going to use most of them for only once in a long time period. It’s such a waste to the environment and to ourselves as well. On the other hand, in my opinion, even though this book blames the advertisers a lot and does not try to understand them, the advertisers are just doing their jobs for a living at some point.

It is ridiculous how many ads we see day. Not only that but the fact that since we are born we are being constantly bombarded with ads that potentially shape us into the people we grow up into. Especially here in America it is in our culture to consume and continue without stopping. Bigger is always better and the more you have the more successful you are. At least that is the mentality. In reality we can be happy with what we need and excess usually ends up in the trash anyways.


<br><hr>
I like your comment. Firstly, it's truly advertisers' job to sell things to the public. The dramatic advertisements catch people's mind and attract them yo buy lots of things they don't really need. It causes too much waste and pollutant to our environment. However, from other aspect, even though the advertisers cause such distorted situations in the market, they just do what they should do. It's important for people to think twice whether they really need something before paying for it. The key to decrease waste in the market is to let people themselves have consciousness and not be fully affected by the advertisement.

I found this article to be especially interesting to me.  The whole time reading it I felt like my whole life had been a huge lie created by these big corporations. They literally play us all the time. Every ad and product we see was made and designed in a certain way to fool us in to buying it. We feel like we are in control of what we buy, but I don't think we really are. Advertising plays with us to make us believe that we need to have this product in order to feel part of the greater group. Another thing I felt played by was how we were told to spend more money in order to fix the recession, media has such a huge impact on how people live, it is insane,  I can't imagine people going out and spending because it was going to help the economy. I also felt played by the way that companies would purposely make things have a deadline, so that we would have to buy the newer products. I definitely need to take a better approach on how I view advertisements and products.

I feel almost the exact same way! I found Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” to be completely shocking. Big corporations being willing to compromise the well being of fellow humans in the name of consumerism is something I will never understand. Hearing and reading about the number of tactics producers use to advertise horrible products, like tobacco, to children is very hard for me to wrap my head around. I find that with every year that I age, I learn new ways that the world around me has manipulated us as a species. I think the creation of a consumerist culture is almost comparable to the domino effect, it starts from a single space, like a single shift in marketing tactics, and then leads to a downfall of the rest, like the need to buy a new product every day. It makes me sad to see how much we have given in to this way of living and allowed ourselves to become slaves to materialism and consumerist culture.


<br><hr>

It almost feels invasive how frequently we see advertising nowadays. Every piece of life has ads packed into it- buses, street signs, billboards, commercials, among many more. The consumer often feels obligated to buy in the guise of supporting the economy. Also, the speed at which things are evolving also make it seem imperative to have the newest model of each commodity, as the speed that things become obsolete has become almost instantaneous. Having to filter through ads so often feels as if we are being indoctrinated to want more and more commodities we'd otherwise not view, even with regulations on adverts in mass media.



<br><hr>

I completely agree,  reading the article a realizing that a lot of this effort to "spend more money" started simply to get us out of the recession blew my mind. As you said companies continue to make us believe we need certain things to fit in. It was first done with cars and appliances and then clothing and makeup brands started doing the same things. Reading about the certain methods that were pointed out in the article, such as companies advertising that you need a new pair of sunglasses for each outfit, was very telling of the consumer culture this has created. It showed that consumer culture is not something new and has been a part of American society for so long. After reading this article its become so easy to see how companies purposely manipulate consumers into buying new things through advertising and social influence.



<br><hr>
I totally agree, this article kinda freaked me out and made me wonder how often I had been manipulated by these large companies that aren't necessarily concerned about making quality product but rather turning us into avid consumers. I wonder how my own life has been structured by this learned consumerism. I think its honestly really terrible, and a sad sad characteristic that defines our current social climate. I think this article was overall enlightening and impressive considering the time it was written. The views expressed were ahead of their time and only remain more prevalent today. The american material economy's primary focus has been turning us into consumers and sadly I feel like I've fallen for the trick. When I think of this disposable culture I see it in every aspect of our lives, and it is really so sad. Quality has been sacrificed for desirability and in the scheme of things this makes no sense. This article is helpful in outlining the dangers of this mentality and for that reason I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Similar to your reaction, I was also appalled by the invasion of marketing in our everyday lives. It is weird to think about how we are basically groomed by corporations and companies into becoming consumers. It makes me reflect on all my purchasing choices and why I made them. For instance, did I truly want the item or was I persuaded by the media to buy it. It is similar to the film that points out how companies target everyone including children. For example, there are companies persuade children to buy pointless items through their parents. Another thing that stood out to me was also the economy and how we are seen as responsible for fixing it by buying more. When we learned about the Great Depression in history I never really thought about the people’s perspective of using the money they barely have to help the economy. It is true that why would people spend it to help a concept rather than themselves.



<br><hr>

I agree 100%. This reading exposed me to just how gullible we as American consumers can be. The marketing industry has us like puppets on strings. Their strategies and rhetoric actually work; we have been "trained" if you will to keep our wallets open for the next generation of the iPhone, the newest pair of Gucci shoes, you name it. Next time I visit a store, I think that I really need to take a step back, and really think about if I really need what I have reached for; I need to reach for the item on the shelf, asking myself what are my intentions for making this purchase. Because a lot of the times, its not a matter of NEED but of WANT. I want to "stay up to date" or I want to be seen in this... that's my problem, I inherently desire the next best thing, as if it will give me power or status. Truth is, materialistic things are temporary, most of what I purchase today will hardly have an effect on my status; the jeans I wear are not going to matter, lets say, ten years from now.

Vance Packard's "The Wastemakers" presents the issue of overproduction in America after World War 2 and corporate America's attempt to fix it. Their solution was to stimulate a culture of overconsumption. It resulted in consumers constantly being introduced to new, unnecessary products and producers designing their products to only last as long as they are profitable. This way of operating the economy is unsustainable and incredibly wasteful.

Going off of this comment, this notion of overconsumption in the 60s really made me think about the disgusting overconsumption in America still today. Since the 60s more and more items get tweaked and resold as a new and improved products, a "must have", despite them carrying out the exact same functions and in reality not being changed much at all. A prime example of modern overconsumption is the consumption of Apple products. People have perfectly working phones and technology, phones far beyond the capabilities of even phones 10 years ago and that the majority of people in the world do not even have access to (depending on their economic situation). Yet, the newest edition comes out, and suddenly a year old phone becomes garbage to them, a thing of the past. Overconsumption is a mentality that has been driven into the minds of Americans for decades now. It is interesting to me that this reading focused a lot on the advertisers and business industry being the root of the problem, because although it is known that of  the marketing strongly influences people,  it is still crazy to me that people often don't think twice about the impact of their consumption (in the 60s AND in the present).

We discuss how the previous generations knew about the climate crisis yet continued to live the way they did, allowing fossil fuel companies to dominate and harm the environment for profit. Their way of making life convenient today ironically forces us to inconvenience ourselves if we want to preserve our earth. Even in the decades before us, they transformed traditional efficiency for consumerism. The first chapter of the book “The Waste Makers” contrasts how today, the average citizen consumes twice as much as one would in the years before WWII. Now, consumption is a major part of our culture because of our efficient automated equipment that is a strong productive force as well as our expansion of these productive facilities. Thus, the idea that ‘there’s always room for more’ emerged. From rugs to women clothing, companies urged that they needed more for style, for a sense of home, for different occasions, and etc. After that, marketers encouraged people to throw things always, things they already owned and used. This contrasts the author Vance Packard who grew up in the culture of using items until they were no longer functional. I really hate how poorly society’s structure and culture was set for my generation.
<br><br>
In relation to this video, what Ken talked about here reminded me more of the film in which multinational corporations continuously exploit their workers, doing so by providing low-wages and poor working conditions. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company knew they were selling a toxic, addictive substance but to maximize profit, they tried to deny the science and continue pushing for sales. This company specifically created an advertising campaign of a cartoon camel within its Camel cigarette brand to make consumers out of children. Both examples exemplify this lack of human decency and consideration. This behavior allows injustice to exist today. Unlike Ken’s generation, I hope mine overturns this. I hope we’re known as the generation that turned the world upside down, changing the norms and tackling all the issues we have in the world from promoting shifts in lifestyle for the sake our environment, addressing the division of classes and sacking the privilege of the rich, continuing to battle against racism and strive for feminism, and etc. There’s so much to be done!

I remember a certain comment was being discussed in regards to how previous generations are the reason why our planet is in a climate crisis. They had said that the previous generations should not be completely discredited because even though the creation of cars, and planes, fast fashion, and digging for oil are all "innovations" that emerged within the past generations that contributed to the climate crisis, they also helped push forward people/society; life is more convenient and "better." "The Waste Makers" have made me realize how people live (at least in first world countries) have drastically changed. Urbanization has pushed us forward in society, but it came with a cost which is the health of our planet. As people discovered more and more ways to make life more convenient, I believe the later generations ended up becoming spoiled. We always want more and we always want it now. Living a simple life, with just the basic necessities is no longer desirable. We don't want a simple life, we want a lavish life. We are raised to thing bigger is better and more is better. That the American dream is being rich and famous. Our capitalistic society has trained us to want more cars, and ride planes and have the latest and trendiest clothes, jewelry, or iPhones. Capitalism+consumerism is essentially making people emit more CO2 into our atmosphere. What worries me is that even though we know the source of why people are emitting more and more CO2, that does not mean we solved the problem. This generation has been influenced and raised by the past generations, we would need to totally and completely change our lifestyles immediately to reverse any effect of climate change, and that is way easier said than done. I will admit, the thought of giving up anything i don't need and resorting to a minimalist/simple life would be extremely hard for me. I care about the Earth and climate change is a problem that my generation needs to solve, but to suddenly change my entire way of living would turn me off. I think it would turn a lot of people off. 

<br><br>
I also hope that our generation can overturn this consumeristic/capitalistic lifestyle. If our generation was able to influence the next generation to be consumers and chase after a rich lifestyle, I believe we can do the same, but backwards. Our generation might not be able to flip our lifestyles right away, but hopefully we can start by one change that will pass onto the next generation who will continue that change we made in our lifestyle, but also make another change that will pass on again. I just hope we will have enough time.

I was totally and completely fascinated after having read The Waste Makers. I was aware to some degree the of the influence of cooperate marketing, however not to the degree that was outlined by the book. The fact that we as Americans consume to the point that “two fifths of what we own are not essential to our well-being” is a crazy statistic. We as a society continue to buy and buy and buy some more and I am definitely part of our consumer society. I was also fascinated by the different types of planned obsolescence and in particular the obsolescence of quality. While reading this I could not help but think of Apple and how iPhone batteries are made to wear out and break down overtime, Apple actually lost in a lawsuit over this and has to sell replacement batteries at a lower price. I have also heard that Apple updates are designed to affect hardware negatively. Before having read this I always thought of that being a radical idea said by those that just look to put apple down, now I am confused on how to think. 
<br><br>

 Our consumer society is greatly affected by corporations and their marketing teams that in turn destroy our environment. However, I place blame on the consumer. A corporation can say whatever they want however they cannot force us to buy and use their products. The responsibility ultimately lies on us. I agree the corporations are very, convincing to advance their greedy plans to make as much profit as possible, but, did they force you to continue to buy? No, they’re just doing their job and are very good at it obviously and the masses have fallen into their hand and have been played by their game. It is time to change our ways and to flip the script if we are going to save our planet.

Reading your comment, I started to think about how not only are we affected by companies and industry directly, but indirectly through celebrities and famous people. So many people look up to those with fame and fortune as a "goal", as something to strive toward in their life. I find it overwhelmingly upsetting that we think of these people as "good examples", feeling envious for what they have, and-in turn- feeling less content with our own lives. Not to mention, the more people that "hop on this bandwagon", the more difficult it is for us to avoid following in their footsteps. We need to start learning and teaching one another that this is not something to aim for, and that we should be happy with what we have every single day. We are lucky just to be alive on this earth, and everything we do out of our discontentment with life does nothing but hurt this planet. It would be so much easier and cheaper to live in the moment and only live with the necessities, and we would be able to gain so much more out of life like this.

We are inundating ourselves with junk. Science devises junk; industry mass-produces it; business ped- dles it; advertising conditions our reflexes to reach for the big red box of it. To be sure, we are skilled junkmen-but what of us? How far have we advanced? We are junk-oriented cave- menl" I found this quote from the book pretty amazing. Especially the last sentence, we are junk-oriented **cave-men**. The industrial revolution and all that came with it, came so quickly. There was never really any discussion about how we should go about endlessly mass producing and mass consuming all this stuff we could suddenly build really quickly. People's quality of life, especially in the U.S rose very quickly, but still deep inside we are those "cave-men". 
<br><br>

These corporations have found a way to tap into the weaknesses formed by this new, fast-moving way things work. They tap into all our fears and insecurities. Furthermore, they use subliminal messaging and other queues to tap into our subconsciousness and invoke our primal instinct for climbing up the ladder, and for consuming. Lastly, the constant questioning "do you want the narrow or wide hat", "classic or modern cut" etc are not only designed to make us buy more, but also methodically break down our mental defences. Surely, if we get bombarded by these message and our forced to make decisions about buying or not all the time, at some point we will give in. It's amazing how skilled and methodical the people behind these things are. 
<br><br>

A modern parallel is they way some of the smartest people in technology, are working at big corporations like google designing algorithms to present ads at the best time and to the most suited people, in order to entice them to buy. It's frustrating that these smart engineers' talents are wasted on something that ultimately degrades our humanity and ruins are planet.

After reading "The Waste Makers" it was very startling about the government's role in working with industries to encourage Americans to constantly buy, despite having no real need for said materials. One would think that a government is supposed to work in their constituents' favor, but instead our government was complicit in industries' efforts to push mass consumerism on the public.  I found it wild that industries tried to get families to buy more cars by marketing one-car families as "victims" who were being "deprived" by the "one-car captivity." By pushing this notion that families who had only one car were captive or confined, it markets cars as being gateways to freedom and made families think they needed a second car, despite doing fine with just one. I found the statement about dog food interesting, in which each year hundreds of pounds of food scraps that used to be for dog food are thrown out each year and families just buy prepared dog food instead. I remember when my family became insistent on meal prepping food for our dogs with acceptable leftovers in order to avoid constantly buying processed dog food. Now my two dogs will roll over and shake at any chance to be given a boiled carrot over a heavily processed biscuit. 
   <br><br>
  I also found it interesting how industries' marketing campaigns targeted women, as they are often the decision-makers of what is being purchased for the household. It is quite unsettling how they push their propaganda on women, pushing the idea of "color-matching" to be crucial in both clothes and for home accessories to feel more accepted by their neighbors, families, and friends.

I agree with you that I didn’t know much about the role that the government played in American consumerism. The way that they promote this type of consumer culture is crazy because they think that the more we buy and spend our money, the economy will be greater. In reality, we just buy stuff that we’re convinced we think we need. As you mentioned, the one car per family thing, is absolutely unnecessary. Families all over the US are being guilt-tripped for only having one car. Every person in a family that can drive does not need their own car, there are other means of getting around.
 <br><br>
While I was reading, I also learned about the way that the population is persuaded to buy cosmetics. Women are targeted to have makeup or nail polish that matched their outfit or for different occasions. I myself have actually done this, and it’s wrong that this is being promoted to us by a very young age. Buying all of this unnecessary stuff just creates more waste on our planet. Even if there’s just a slight upgrade on an item, people will leave their perfectly fine item for the new one. What happens to the one they just left?? The amount of waste this is created because of the way companies promote items to us is sad. We are so wrapped up about looking good and making sure we have the bets of the best, we don’t realize what we’re spending our money on. This, in turn, creates more waste and poses a threat to our planet.


<br><hr>
I agree when you say that a government is supposed to in their constituents favor. However our government wanted us to funnel money into the economy so it focused on quantity of sales over quality of products and goods. Another thing that I related to in your comment is the idea of "color-matching". While growing up, my Mother made it very clear to me that everything had to match. My Mom has matching bed spreads for Christmas and other bed sets for spring. Every Sunday at church my Mom would pick out clothes for our entire family so that we all matched in Sunday service. Her favorite store when I was a child was Gymboree. As a 5 year old I probably would have been fine wearing anything as long as there were clothes on my body. However, my Mom wanted to buy all the matching outfits with coordinated hair barrettes and socks. I was dressed up like a barbie doll. Consumer culture is definitely evident in my Mothers case and many American mothers have also been conditioned to behave this way by the consumer propaganda that is so wide spread in our society. 
  <br><br>
   An additional comment I had was that the reading shows us how industries have practiced progress through planned obsolescence. This is evident with products today like iPhones. I have noticed that by the time I'm done paying for my phone I have had it for about 2 years and then by 4 years my phone is very slow due to updates that no longer function with my device. I then desire  a newer model and apple has a new model come out every few years. This is smart and planned marketing on their end but it is at the expense of the consumer. Engineers are no longer aiming to make high quality and lasting products because people will never have to buy the product again if theirs is still working fine. You have to get a product to last long enough that the consumer finds it reasonable to purchase it again but not last too long to where the person never has to buy it again. Even just writing all that sounded little twisted.
  <br><br>
   We have been conditioned to throw things away. If a shirt only costs $5 then when we are tired of wearing it we will just toss it in the trash. ITs crazy how being wasteful has become a normality.

These chapters did not surprise me in the least. Coming from a high activity city, I'm surrounded by tourists 24/7. It’s almost like NYC itself is a product to be bought. People fill stores, and pay for horse and buggy carriage through Central Park, swarm my neighborhood to buy useless jewelry and clothing branded to say “I’ve been there!” None of this is because of necessity. There is both a push and pull in this system. On one end, consumers get bored and search for novelty, and on the other hand, markets are constantly searching for new things to make people think they want. It’s almost appalling that they estimated consumption had to increase by 50%, which means there are people sitting in a room thinking up products directly to hit consumer markets and milk peoples wallets. They have literally created a consumer culture and tricked everyone into following it. The hardest part is that it is uncomfortable to move against what everyone else is doing, so the natural flow supports an increase in how much is consumed. 

  <br><br>

His reference to Brave New World highlighted our similarities to a dystopian novel where the entire society revolves around a seamless need to consume. One of the protagonists of the novel is struggling because he cannot get on board with everyone else’s wave. He is both excited by his individualism, and distraught with his inability to connect. It has created a system that fosters discomfort when one tries to break away from it. His struggle is not unique.

Death-dating reminded me of what happens with iPhones. People line up down the block to get the new one even if there is nothing wrong with their current phone.

I really agree with your comment, especially the last point about the iPhone. When discussing consumerism, I always think about how whenever a new phone comes out, everyone who owns one of the previous models is made to feel as if they are missing out, even though it still works just fine. In the "Waste Makers," Packard talks about how 2/5ths of a person's possessions are not essential for their well-being. This is an astounding number, but I find it even more astonishing how quickly we feel the need to replace many of our possessions, even if they work just fine. This is clearly shown with the iPhone. We are led to believe that we "need" the new one when it comes out even though ours works fine. This is because the new one may have some fun or innovative features that draw our attention. This is not only seen with the iPhone, other companies market their products in a similar way. When a new style of shoe is released from any given brand, we feel as if we need it, even though the ones we already own still fit perfectly fine. The same is seen with many brands of clothing as well as technology such as laptops, cameras, and tablets.

Making Waste (of the planet)
  <br><br>

 After reading The Waste Makers, I was disgusted! Finding out that marketers were strategic in trying to make consumers buy more things was no surprise. However, actually hearing the different tactics marketers would use made me feel manipulated. Fashion styles change not because people are expressing their creativity, but because companies purposefully market new trends. Planned obsolescence is what I found especially gross. The fact that that companies have the ability to make products that last a long time, but refuse to do so because they want to make money is horrible. Big corporations were able to shift Americans into valuing things that they can throw away, rather than durable things that last forever. Often times blame is put on the people for supporting big companies through their purchasing power. However, the people are greatly effected by advertising.  I believe that both the companies and the people have a responsibility. Companies need to be better in creating sustainable, durable products, while consumers need to put their money towards these greener companies. We have the power to undue our conditioning!  I believe that marketing could play a powerful role in switching the American mindset into being more eco-friendly!

I totally agree with your disgust and disappointment towards the strategic tactic of planned obsolescence of desirability. I was always raised to spend my money wisely and use products/items until they no longer function; however, most Americans don't have this same outlook or perspective unfortunately. They essentially measure their relevance or status by the up keeping of their possessions. This is incredibly saddening as we are not only letting these selfish companies unnecessarily gauge us, but we are allowing these companies to continuously damage our planet. They are only looking out for their own well-being and fortune meanwhile they are causing indescribable damage to our earth. These powerful companies have everything they need to create durable and sustainable products, yet they still over prioritize their own success. I like how you mentioned that not all fault falls onto these guilty companies. It is us as the consumers that are allowing this behavior to be prolonged. We are giving them the power and money to keep coming out with "new and improved" products when in reality, these new products are just different colors or more modern looking to the populations' eyes.

It's crazy to me that corporations are profiting huge amounts of money from us and are willing to go horrific measures to keep their products in the hands of consumers. When professor Ken was talking about the tobacco companies creating advertisements that dismissed the scientific data that smoking leads to cancer, doing anything possible to continue profiting from human suffering for a long time. This is horrific to me because companies like this don’t care about our well being they are basically killing us and we are so blinded by the propaganda they put out there that we let them destroy us slowly by consuming their products. I remember when I was around 13 the tobacco company had released its flavored vape pen that was advertised as being “nonaddicting, not harmful to you, containing no nicotine and the best part, coming in many of your favorite flavors.” It was advertised and promoted to even younger boys through social media, TV, and ads. The vape pen became popular among the youth and I even remember my older brother buying one just for the curiosity of it since most of his friends at school were using it. Later on, the news came out saying that the pen was not as safe as many people believed it was, it had side effects such as possible addiction, some still contained nicotine, and the flavored smoke was still indeed harmful to your lungs and health. The youth had already consumed the product multiple times and soon the vape pen was losing its trendiness but the tobacco industry kept on producing more products and people started buying more harmful drugs. Overall it just astonishes me how far corporations like these are willing to go just to profit from our consumption and it frustrates me that many of us are blinded by them and don’t see how much it is affecting our health and our environment by releasing harmful gases into the air when smoking.

While reading the book "Wastemakers" consumerism is broken down and analyzed. Consumerism role is to continue to keep us addicted to the next best thing even when we do not have an actual need for it. We try to fill a void and place happiness on objects- hoping that the addition of a new item in our collection will make us feel whole. This need was only further catalyzed after World War 2 where consumerism became a national practice due to the manufacturers being able to be produce at a higher rate. The perspective on material possessions had shifted greatly. Materials were once preserved and were valued for the longevity in one's lifetime has now become infiltrated with the idea of more is better. We no longer consider its functionality-the importance lies on the physical appearance of the product. Planned Obsolescence has completely taken over and has allowed corporations to take advantage of consumers at a very low cost. The most prevalent example in this time would be the consumption of apple products. Every couple of years a newer version of the same product is release, and we know that the product we already own is still in working conditions. There is still a line wrapped around the block on the released date though. A newer color, higher camera resolution, and a few new innovations: causes an uproar.

  <br><br>

As Packard explains in the novel, the United States economy is fueled by the consumption frenzy of its people. To me it is insane that we care more about the economy at this point in time rather than the state of the future for the upcoming generations and environment. We have been accustomed to the instant gratification that comes with purchasing new objects that are not needed. It has gotten to the point that this instant gratification has lined up with planned obsolescence. We buy things ahead of time, knowing that the object will break, and feel a sense of fulfillment quickly after.

I found this reading really interesting. Throughout the whole thing I found myself forgetting it was written so long ago. The whole book answers Kens question, How did Americans become avid consumers? This is all due to marketing techniques that have made us wasteful. One fact I found relevant to this is when they said the average citizen must increase spending by 50% in the next ten years or the economy will sicken. It is very interesting that our spending is what can make or break the economy. Another reason why companies keep promoting more and more consumption is because factories can produce tremendously fast. Therefore they want to get the biggest paycheck they can. A fact that the book stated for when this all happened is around the 50s after the war. It said that from 1957 to 1958, an extra 4 billion dollars was spent? But why is that? Are marketing strategies that good? The answer is that what people spent their money on changed. It went from appliances to amusement and soft purchases like clothes and tobacco.
  <br><br>

 Another thing I found very interesting is our consumption of fashion. For example it said nail companies promoted selling more by buying a color for each mood. Or another example I found interesting was swimsuit companies. In this book they talked about the promotion for a new swimsuit for a different activity. This is very true and I am a part of it. I own a lot of bathing suits because I have felt by society I cannot wear the same one every day. This is also connected to dresses. They mention an example of a wife saying she needs a new dress. But the only reasoning is because it is out of style. The fashion industry has made society believe we need new clothing all the time to keep up with the 52 season when in reality this is causing a horrible impact on the environment.

I agree!! I especially agree with how you said you found yourself forgetting that it was written long ago. This reading was very interesting. It was also quite shocking. One point that stood out the most for me was the part about the potato peeler. It is sad to know that they decided to make the tool the color of the potato just so it could be thrown out and be purchased again. The book even mentions how they even knew that the color of the tool would be boring and not draw interest so they spent time on the color of the packaging (which is thrown out once opened.) That was disturbing. 
  <br><br>
I also connected with the part about the dresses, but for me I connected to the part where I believe it mentioned "a craved excuse for a new dress." I connected with it because whenever there is an event, I believe that I should get a new dress. I think most of the thought in that is also to not be seen in the same dress I had worn at the previous event. The fashion industry has sparked our cravings of wanting new clothes, and its impacts are very disturbing.

<br><hr>

Yes! I was so shocked how modern this sounded! I felt like I was reading something that had come out this year. I thought the potato peeler was super interesting too. It is shocking how companies make a certain tool so that it will break or be lost super easily. I think that when it mentioned packaging was super interesting as well. That they would say something is “new” but the only new thing about it is the packaging. I connected to the part when they talked about craving an excuse for a new piece of clothing as well. I sometimes even wish I would have an event to go to so that I could buy a new dress. I remember for prom I would get a new dress, that has never been worn again, a waste. I think the way the fashion industry has changed is very disturbing as well, from 2 to 52 seasons has really stuck with me

After reading "The Waste Makers" I have come to agree with your comment on the market relying on our consumption. If we all were to stop buying from major companies, it would take a huge toll on our economy. So we, the consumers, are stuck in a tough situation in which we cannot completely stop buying from a particular industry, but we have to change who we buy from. If we start to buy from more truly environmentally safe companies, our environment will remain increasingly more healthy. Unfortunately, just as the book explains, marketing techniques used towards us have made Americans rapid buyers and wasters. The majority of Americans know which brands are "in" and which ones are not. Typically, the more popular brands do not tend to be environmentally safe when it comes to their means of production and ridding of unsold items. People continue to buy from these brands, and our Earth is continuing to suffer. Just like the example mentioned in the book about how consumption of different items changed during the war, I believe the only way for America to turn their ways of consumption around is going to be from consuming more environmentally sustainable things. I also think some people will definitely start to consume less because they are aware of the implications that arise environmentally. If both of these things start to happen, our home will remain healthy, and so will our economy.

In the reading “Waste Makers” by Vance Packard, Packard lays out a study of consumerism that took place 60 years ago in 1960. While this is not updated to modern time, it is nevertheless shocking. One of the first facts that I encountered was one of the most interesting, in my opinion. This fact was that, “nearly two-fifths of the things [the average citizen] owns are things that are not essential to his physical well-being.” I found this interesting because, even in 1960, overconsumption in the United States was a serious problem. I guess thinking about this time period as the beginning of Ken’s generation, which is the generation arguably responsible for this crisis, it is less surprising. Overconsumption has been a problem for so long and little thought has been put as to what this does to the environment. The focus was always rapidly expanding the economy, even though in order to do this, “the average citizen [would] have to step up [their] buying by nearly 50 percent.” 
  <br><br>

There were greater issues at this time because Say’s law (a law that states that supply creates its own demand) became less relevant. Because the 1960’s were characterized as an era of abundance, desire did not keep pace with productivity so consumers would need to be persuaded to buy more of each product. Marketers had to use tactics like color matching and two-or-more-of-a-kind to appeal to consumers and be able to get more sales. I know that, today, marketers also use tactics in order to ensure more sales like promising happiness and higher status. Rampant consumerism is the result of tireless marketers who ensure that people always have things to buy and more than that, always feel the need to. 
  <br><br>

I was also surprised to read about aerosol cans and how they can make food like whipped cream and chocolate syrup seem like they are empty when, in reality, there is still some left. This makes the consumer want to buy more of the product. I can relate to this because I was a counselor in Scouts and a lot of the activities that we would do would involve whipped cream. I remember the first time I bought whipped cream, I only purchased one can, assuming it would be enough. When I actually used it, it was only enough for half of my kids and I was being stingy. Since then, I would always buy at least two and maybe even three. There was also a time where one of the cans didn’t even work so I can assume that this design would be profitable for the company considering people, in order to get whipped cream, would be forced to buy more than what they really need.

Reading this comment made me think a lot about how online advertising is specified to each person. "Cookies" on websites that people visit transfer over, so when people are scrolling through Facebook they will often see ads pop up for the Lulu's dress they were browsing earlier that week, or the boots they were considering purchasing. This goes back to how in the 1960's, people would have to step up their consuming rate by around 50 percent. Back then, technology wasn't giving them endless options fit to their interests. That is why consumption is so dangerous now with ever-advancing technology. People may not be looking to buy anything, but when that ad pops up for the perfect pair of jeans they are automatically inclined to buy them, especially if they're set at an incredibly discounted price. What Vance Packard was writing about in the 60's has only gotten worse as advertisers brand themselves specific to their customers niches. It goes all the way back to his fear of, "the ever-growing efficiency of the United States productive force, thanks in large part to the introduction of automated equipment in the offices and factories of nearly a hundred thousand United States companies." This has only gotten worse since the publication of "The Waste Maker."

I really find your response interesting especially about her own experience with the whipped cream cans which I found very interesting. I did not even think about the fact that if a whipped cream can is a defect and won't work, you can't do anything about it besides go buy another can which is exactly what these corporations want. I also liked that she brought up the fact that marketers use tactics like promising happiness and higher status when buying their product because this is something that we see everywhere. Marketers selling high end clothes, jewelry, technology, cars, homes, and even food make it seem like if you invest in their product everything in your life will be perfect. This brings us back to the point that money does not always buy happiness. There are so many celebrities that have millions or even billions of dollars and are still not happy. Just like they talked about in last weeks film "Minimalism: A Documentary About The Important Things", one cannot fill a void in their life with material things. That is just not how it works. As long as marketers continue to produce, Americans will continue to consume. I feel like this is a topic that is not talked enough about which is why it is such a large problem in this country. More people need to be educated about what mass production is doing to our planet and how it contributing to the climate crisis.

After reading the first few chapters of "Waste Makers" by Vance Packard, I found a new sense of clarity on the topic of the climate crisis, as the information that has been presented in this course so far seemed to finally come into focus. I feel like, so far, I have been presented with so many facts about what has brought about this growing issue in our world, but until this week, did I truly see how our nation specifically has contributed to our current situation. This week's reading presented a complete study of consumerism that took place in the 1960's. I was reminded of what our nation was going through during this time; war, a need for national moral, and unity. So therefore, it makes total sense that the US economy advertised products heavily and tried to inspire consumerism among its citizens. As the text explains, this was our attempt to stimulate our economy and bring the nation together during wartime. I remember learning about this time period in my AP US History class, junior year of high school, but it wasn't until now that I realized this was just the beginning of our fall into consumption as a nation wide addiction. The way in which our lives have been shaped by our shopping habits today, mirrors the lifestyle of the average American citizen in the 1960's.

  <br><br>

I came across several interesting comments after watching this video, but I wanted to reply to your's specifically because I too was captivated by this fact from the text: "nearly two-fifths [the average citizen] owns are things that are not essential to his physical well-being." This statistic is mind blowing; very believable, but still crazy to think about. This week's reading, as well as this video, validate that our nation's consumerism is a product of the efforts of all of our corporations and their marketing teams to ensure that we will always have something new to purchase and the feeling that we need to. This is the reason why almost half of the things that we own have no real function or add any value to our lives. We are made to believe that what we are buying is necessary to make our lives better, but instead, it is necessary to keep their companies running and their bank accounts growing. That is crazy. On the other hand, I too was able to draw the connection between 1960 being a time of overconsumption as well as the start of the 60 years that brought about a 100 ppm increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Ken explained in previous lectures that 1959, the year he was born, was the start of the generation that is responsible for the severity of the climate crisis today. Therefore, it does not surprise me that the 1960's was an era of abundance, consumption, and striving for the American Dream. All of these traits are reasons why we have avoided, or in a way didn't see, the consequences of our actions and our now forced to take urgent action towards change.

I never really thought about how insane American consumerism is until reading some chapters of Vance Packard’s book “The Waste Makers.” In these chapters he really emphasized our culture of consumption. Industries really push for consumers to upgrade at the nearest opportunity. They do this by making it clear their products have short expiration dates. Also in the fashion industry they control the narrative of what's fashionable. They really try to set the trend of what's good and what's not. What may be incredibly popular one year may be really out of date in just a few years. This causes society to throw away those items and move on to the next one. Another example of this is the tech industry. For example, Apple rolls out with a new iPhone every year with minimal significant upgrades. Despite consumers already having a perfectly working iPhone, they are pushed to upgrade when it is not necessary. This really expedites resources being wasted and it is terrible for our environment (and in my opinion society because it really makes people materialistic).

Packard’s 1960 study of consumerism really put into perspective that American culture has led the world as a whole, too many climate issues. Our consumer lifestyle has fueled corporations to exploit the natural resources around the world, and the poorest people on this planet. Consumerism in the U.S. to me has always been something that was laughable. I never saw the need to buy new shoes even when there was a whole in it. Regardless if they were in style or not. However, many other people always feel the need to buy the newest version of everything, or just add more clothes to their already large collection. The idea to consume has been implemented in our heads from a young age by corporations in their commercial shown on television. Not only do people just buy things but without considering where the product came from and how it came to be. Buying new cars or lots of cars caused your carbon footprint to rise drastically. People buy lots of things but never consider the environmental impacts behind their purchases.

The Wastemakers article really helped me understand how capitalism truly is the root of so many of our issues. After World War II manufacturing had to change because we no longer needed to make weapons. So what do we make? Make things people need, like vacuums and cars. But what happens when everyone has one vacuum, one car, on television set, etc? Make better vacuums and cars and television sets. But then everyone has the newest things and it’s time to make more things. But the things we make are not things we really need. 
  <br><br>

Things also became about convenience. Plastic packaging is a major issue and is all about convenience. You can buy your meals from a restaurant or store, and when you’re done, just throw the packaging away. No dishes to clean. No worries. We have a throw-away culture because when trash is out of sight it’s out of mind. But sooner than later trash will be very much in sight. It scares me to think about how we are running out of places to put our garbage. 
  <br><br>

It was also interesting and sad to read about how fear of recession caused even more spikes  in consumerism. Eisenhower himself recommended people to buy as many things as they could because it would help GDP growth. I understand wanting a booming economy, but endless growth isn’t good for us.

The fact that appliances such as the ones you listed are replaced by "better" items triggers an interesting question that applies to all things. How much "better" can something be made. If we look at modern cars, there is no doubt that the common argument for them is that they are simply better than old cars. Are they though? They serve the same exact purpose with very similar features. In my opinion, modern cars are not "better". They are filled with unnecessary features. Do we really need heating seats with options to adjust how firm your seat is, cameras to replace the simple action of turning your head to check for other cars, or wifi in cars. We don't need them. Previous generations did just fine without them. A car to go from point a to b. Now that we are in this stage of car manufacturing, when they seem to be at their peak, what other crazy ideas are car companies going to have to come up with to make last year's car obsolete to the public interest?

Another item that this reading had me thinking about is cosmetics. Many of us struggle with acne and its okay because it is natural. But facial care companies convince us that we need to do something about it. I know people who own more bottles of acne solution and facial cream that can fit in their bathroom. Facial products are filled with the same attention grabbing catch phrases-"#1 Dermatologist recommend", "GUARANTEED no clear your face", and other phrases like these that are unpromising. The abundance of facial products makes the consumer feel as if they are not using the "right one" so they have to branch out and try them all. Just when they find the one and after serious use, it "stops working", onto another. This is the same cycle that consumers are stuck in just like that of fast fashion and other products made to become obsolete. After all, if one facial product did the trick, there would be no need for people to buy any more. There would be no business. Facial products don't work. 
  <br><br>


This rant on facial products can relate to climate change contribution in that the production of facial products are probably just as environmentally unfriendly as any other mass produced food.

I completely agree with your comment. It's so crazy to me how our economy and our capitalist society are constantly encouraging us to buy new things. Going off an example used in class, the fact that a new Iphone is released every year is just one thing that relates both to lecture and to the reading. I know people that still have older models of iphones, and to be completely honest, I find myself wondering why they have such an old phone (that sounds so horrible, but it's true). Our society makes it so having older things and using them to their fullest potential is seen as "not good enough". This is so relevant to my life too- I have the second to newest iphone and I find myself wanting the new one, just because it looks cool. This type of consumerism is so scary- not only for our own mental health, but for our planet as well. As the rate of production goes up because of the desire for new things, so does the rate of emissions and release of toxins into nature etc. This is the same situation for the fashion industry. I have seen this first hand after working in the industry- people buying clothes, taking an instagram picture in them, and then donating them/throwing them away to get the newest thing. Fast fashion companies make it so they release new products weekly- and that is utterly terrifying when you think of the environmental impact.

I heavily agree, this article made me realize more and more that our capitalistic economy is the root of so many off our current issues. What I didn't realize about this issue was how we claim that "this product is continuously being made because we need to make this product bigger and better", when really, there nothing being better about my vacuum or my phone. And I am sad to say, we see this a lot with phone companies making "better" products to "fit our needs". I feel like if Packard was living in our current times, he will be disappointed in how much we consume day in and day out because we are so influenced to think we "need" to.

  <br><br>

I knew that thanks to WW2, America was able to come out of the Great Depression because of the slogan "buy, buy, buy" was so powerful and the propaganda behind buying stuff is helping us out. What I never realized is that mentality has been around for so long ever since Eisenhower exclaimed the only way to show our "patriotic duty" is to be good consumers. A lot of us after reading this article are aware now of the problems on consumerism, but I am unsure how many of us will remember this article when the newest iPhone comes out with 4 cameras. Both corporations and obsessed consumers are the problem here, we both feed each other into this manipulative cycle of constantly believing "we need to make this" or "we need to buy this". If we don't stop this vicious cycle, then we are going to continue destroying our planet all for the sake of a new phone or a new brand of shoes.

I agree with this because it is what I relate to unfortunately. We have been brought us and become used to the idea that we need to constantly buy things and waste money for no reason. Before I got to college, I would continuously as my parents for money but as soon as I started working, I realized that everything I wanted, I did not need. A part of me just thinks that people will eventually grow out of the money spending phase. Another part of me thinks that we are already growing out of it because of everything on the internet with things such as Netflix because we are not driving a car to go to cinema. There is definitely a change but the outcome of making things simpler and closing off certain suppliers would cause more jobs to close off and that would affect the economic wealth and although we would not need all the money being spread in the economy if we are buying less, the need for money by people will take a long time to go down.

I agree with your comment about how big companies want the consumer to keep on buying their products. For example the apple watch series three was made as well as a different variation that has “cellular” which made the watch usable without your phone around. The cellular option costs one hundred dollars more than the regular apple watch but people wanted the best new thing so they bought the most expensive one. Many companies change one little thing in their product and sell it for more or call it a new style and the public gets fooled by advertisements giving the people the urge to buy the “new’ fashion style. 
   <br><br>
Just like you said, “things also became about convenience.” Many people buy products that make things easier for them. They may already have an item that does the same thing as the one that they are going to buy but the only difference is that it makes the task more convenient to complete. For example a crock pot. It is an electrical pot that can cook rice for you by just setting a timer and you don’t have to worry about it and you can go do something else while it's cooking. You could use a regular pot to cook the rice but you have to take care of the rice so that it doesn’t burn. People don’t want to worry about things they want the easy way so they are willing to buy more to make things more convenient.



<br><hr>
I agree with this comment and the central idea that capitalism is the root to a majority of these issues we have today. After WWII the amount of rampant production the United States saw was simply ridiculous. We started advertising as a result and the mere exposure to a new social norm was enough to start this trend of acquiring more "stuff." We created a market specifically designed to grow, and it doesn't help that people want more and more stuff. It's extremely scary to see how much people always need more stuff. I also notice the fact that Anabel talked about plastic packaging. It is extremely a bad idea although people didn't care as it was more convenient. It created a throw-away culture and is just one of the issues that adds on to this "waste maker" idea. Even the government encouraged people to keep on purchasing and purchasing as it would "help GDP growth." We can only grow to a certain degree, and it is nor more clear than ever that we have reached that point. Ken makes a repeating point that people need to change their ideals and mindset...I couldn't agree more. Technology and change in political power can only take us so far. We are at one of those rare points in our history where we need radical change from a majority of people, not just the few at the top.

I feel completely the same as your first paragraph. People invent or create multiple options for customers to make more unnecessary purchases. In this case, customers will always be interested in the new things but waste the old things they already have. Worse, the old things sometimes only considered second hand, but in a pretty new situation. These people will soon become the waste makers, worsening the problem of consumerism. It is worth alerting and instilling people about the importance of living frugally. Even though it might negatively influence the economic aspects of the producers, it is a global issue that people have to face. The reading really scared me with the number of waste people contribute. As long as we can reduce one unit of unnecessary item in our lives, we can make a closer step to solve consumerism.

<p>
The Waste Makers, written in 1960s, analyzed the essence of consumerism and materialism at that era. Although 60 years has passed, it is still worth reading today because it helps us to think. Compared to the past, consumerism develop rapidly and is much more terrible than before. Companies now produce many strategies to transform us into the fast-moving waste machines. If we do not pay attention, we will fall into their trap easily and never escape. Packard mentioned three types of methods: planned obsolescence of function, quality, and desirability. I cannot agree more. In the summer of 2016, two brands of cell phone quickly became popular in my country: Vivo and Oppo. Their marketing strategy was to launch new products in a rapid rate. These "new" products were similar to the old ones, but the companies successfully persuaded customers that their cell phones were really outdated by using advertisements. Many young people believed their lies and wasted a lot of money. However, just as Ken's video pointed out, it is really hard to stop these companies' actions: "corporations have been willing to do extraordinary things in the name of profit." All we need to do is stick to correct principles and spread the right ideas to people around us.

“Everything we make is thrown away.” Vance Packared really laid out the problem with the consumer mindset in this simple sentence. We don’t think of buying things as throwing things away, but that is what will happen to them in a couple years. We are living in the “disposable era.”
   <br><br>
This piece really interested me. I had never really thought about how we became the consumers that we did. Vance Packared really laid out how this process was happening. He uses a lot of concrete examples which were very interesting to hear and things that I don’t think about behind advertisements. For example, Kleenexes having to be a different color in each room in your house, or how much companies’ adversities that two houses were needed so that in the end that you would buy more products.  
     <br><br>
       What also struck me that I didn’t know about was it was not always the big companies; it was the growing dependence on the economy. So the government would spend money to tell crop owners to plant more crops than they would need, this was a viscous cycle. Being exposed to the behind the scene of consumerism and how it really took off after the war and fall of the economy was fascinating and really made me think about kens question. 
       <br><br>
     I think that it is going to be up to both the companies and people to get off of the consumer bit. One really can’t work without the other. However, I think that first change must come from the companies. The problem is if they give up their advertisement then they likely, loose their income and then their lively hoods, the problem I think that this is in the future no matter what. Our economy is going to decline, and we are going to have to deal with the consequences. If people can accept the fact that they don’t need all of the newest items from all of the newest fashion and trends, then we might actually make progress. 
        <br><br>
    As Packared said “American have great unrecognized wants which they will inevitably discover. They just need to be educated and activated.” I think this goes not only for companies trying to sell stuff, but also for how to combat the issue of consumerism. I think that Americas know what is good for the environment subconsciously yet aren’t doing anything. I think that if they were educated and activated change might be able to take place.

 I 100% agree with you that it would take both the company and the consumers to get off the consumer bit in order for change to occur. I believe that most companies would not want to give up their profit from selling clothes in order to cause change by lessening their advertisements and declining sales. I believe that Packard was right that we live in an era of extreme consumerism and it grew immensely after the war due to the increase in productions and the utilization of foreign countries for production of items. People do need to be educated and activated on the issues and the negative effects of living a materialistic life and how it harms the lives of millions of people and is slowly killing the planet. I agree that our economy will inevitably decline and while I too think that people need to understand that fact and accept it now, I also believe that most companies and consumers will not realize it until it truly occurs. 
   <br><br>

Before this I was unaware that the government would spend money to help the economy  by paying off crop owners to plant more crops and by doing this it is increasing the area and land usage and by implementing pesticide use and GMO's it kills that land and soil. I also find it interesting that companies have to put immense thought behind their advertisements, which, are designed to trick consumers into purchasing their products. It is crazy to me how much detail goes into each commercial, every advertisement and after watching the Super Bowl game I realized that they put so much into these commercials for the item to appear one time, its not about the item its about the appeal. In order for change to happen we need to get rid of the appeal of purchasing these items as it continues to generate a materialistic society and we cannot have that society if we want to save the world. Consumerism truly is based on waste and it sure is true that our society generates a lot of waste. Sadly a lot of people treat their items like London Tipton, they never wear any outfit twice.

I like what you said about government contributing to this "throw-away" economy that we still live in (and has become worse over time). When I was reading the chapter, I was also surprised that the government told people to buy everything and anything in order to contribute to the economy. Since the Great Depression and the patriotic calls of WWII were still fresh in people's minds, it is no surprise that people would react to Eisenhower telling people to buy things by buying more things than they need or even want. It was also interesting to see how this problem was further exacerbated by the Cold War since the US felt a need to keep its status as the only superpower left after WWII and were not to be defeated by the USSR. Because of this collective American opinion and the fact that people were rightfully terrified of nuclear war if the US were to become suddenly inferior to the Soviet Union, it makes sense that people would begin a culture of impulsively buying then throwing away too many things. This is why the comments about government really struck me. I believe that it is the government's job to protect people and make the lives of Americans better--a big part of this is protecting the planet. Even though the government is failing to protect us from environmental doomsday, I still think there is at least a sliver of hope that comes from us living in a democracy. We have the power, as citizens and constituents, to demand climate action from our government. And it is our duty as human beings who live on planet earth to do so. These chapters highlighted why it is important to register to vote, keep up with local politics (at least a little bit), be aware of when elections are, and to vote in climate leaders. The government is doing the same thing now as it did when Eisenhower was president. If we want the government to stop getting in bed with fossil fuel companies and to make it easier for consumers to buy more eco-friendly products, we have to demand it from them.

The book, "The Vase Makers," by Vance Packard, was a disappointing (but not overly surprising) read for me. The planned obsolescence Packard describes is, I feel, genius in the most evil way. I would expect nothing less from the major corporations, sadly. He describes the notion that companies will go to great lengths to keep gaining profit on their products. We can see this idea summed in a quote by Paul Mazur, a leading promoter of consumerism. He states, “It is absolutely necessary that the products that roll from the assembly lines of mass production be consumed at an equally rapid rate and not be accumulated in inventories.” In other words, companies are fully dependant on consumers. If their product does not make a profit, they have failed. 
   <br><br>

Because of this, I believe that the problem of obsessive consuming is not the fault of the consumer, but the companies. As seen throughout the book, sellers will go to great lengths to ensure people will keep buying their product, even if it means reducing the quality of the good. If companies highlighted the fact that their jacket has a lifetime guarantee, as Patagonia does, consumers wouldn’t want to buy new ones every season. Rather, they would buy it for functionality, because otherwise it is wasteful. For my family, a trip to patagonia was a big deal. We got to pick out a jacket that we would use for the next couple of years, at least. This can be contrasted with the way people of my generation view Forever 21. Unfortunately, Forever 21 has done a great job at playing the consumers, because every time I go in one, I see something I think I need, even if I don’t. Also, embarrassingly enough, in the occasion that I go to forever 21 two days in a row, it feels like there is almost always new inventory. Forever 21 is an example of a company that has mastered planned obsolescence. 
   <br><br>

The way I see it, consumers consume what we are told to, or we follow the lead of others. We get new iPhones every season because Apple has told us that the older generations are far inferior than the new models, and society inforces it.
   <br><br>
A response to a journal article about obsolescence reads, “Let's stop all this researching and developing for a while! We're up to our glasses in 'progress' now.... We are inundating ourselves with junk.” I think this quote is really meaningful, because even in the 1960s, people were noticing that Americans were living an unsustainable and idiotic lifestyle. Some also called it a “crime.” The way we consume has only gotten worse over time.

Similarly to you, I wasn’t all that surprised by the tactics used by these major corporations. The more I become immersed in the world of consumerism, the more I notice how planned obsolescence is sneakily integrated into everything. As you said, it’s genius in the most evil way. What I like about this book is that the attack isn’t on the consumers, but rather the companies. From a distance, it may seem like it is the consumers faults for constantly buying new things, throwing away “old” things, but in reality, the companies are doing all of this on purpose as a means of gaining more profit. What are the consumers supposed to do when their appliances break, as a result of planned obsolescence? We live in a day and age where we 100% rely on companies and corporations to supply our needs. If they make it so that we have to buy new things (in reference to the planned obsolescence of quality, not desirability), there isn’t much we can do other than go buy the thing we need. We are fully dependent on companies, just as they are fully dependent on us. If we need more, we go purchase items from the companies, but as you said, if their product doesn’t make a profit, they have failed.
   <br><br>

In reference to what I said earlier about noticing this planned obsolescence more and more, one specific example I have is Apple. They come out with new iPhone every year or so, and in order for consumers to keep buying their new products, they implement multiple types of obsolescence. The first is the obsolescence created by gain in function, which is the only respectable one. Although the new features may seem slim with each new iPhone, there is always some new aspect that is better than the last. The other type of obsolescence used is that of quality, which is incredibly unfair for the price of a single iPhone. I notice that after a year or so of having a new phone, things stop working as well. The main thing I always notice is battery life. After a while, my phone doesn’t stay charged for nearly as long as it used to. I thought that was just because my phone was getting old, but that is just me getting brainwashed by Apple. How could such a pristine piece of technology be considered “old” after only a year? Thing is, it isn’t old. But Apple plans it this way so that by the time the iPhone comes out, we are in need of a new one because of the degradation of the older product. Another thing I’ve noticed happen to both myself and a few of my friends is that the microphone and volume will stop working which is when you really have to get a new phone. When the microphone stops working, you can no longer call, which completely defeats the purpose of a phone. When that happened to me, I thought I was a special case, but I recently discovered Apple does this on purpose as a way of getting consumers to buy new phones.
   <br><br>

Consumers are caught in this vicious cycle that is going to be very hard to break. Moving towards a more minimalist lifestyle is definitely a good start, as consumers will start relying less and less on corporations. That being said, the future looks pretty grim since basically everything is involved in consumerism and capitalism. But in order to even begin solving this issue of climate change, we must break these habits and make radical changes.

As I was reading Vance Packard’s classic 1960 study of consumerism: The Waste Makers, I became aware of what the producers are producing and how they are getting so many consumers to buy the product: through pure manipulation. Packard explains the steps that producers take to influence their previous consumers; one being to “dream up a new or improved product”. This means that the producers will just make something up and make it to be perceived as better than the “older” version, when in reality it might as well be the same product. I see this through the new iphones today; they come up with a new version but the one in the previous year looks and functions very similar. The producers are manipulating our society to consume. The marketing consultant, Victor Lebow, explains “forced consumption” as so: “We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced, and discarded at an ever increasing rate”. The fact that that was and is the main goal of producers makes me astonished and angry. 
    <br><br>
I, as a consumer, am guilty of purchasing the ‘new’ and ‘improved’ stuff that comes every year and now that I know what’s really going on behind the scenes I will decrease in the amount that I buy and falling for the producers tricks. I believe that it is partially the consumers fault for falling for the manipulations and not being able to hold ourselves accountable and understand that what we do have is good enough. However, in order for this to change, it is on the producers to be honest with their products and stop this “forced consumption” mentality.

Your iPhone analogy was a perfect example of what Packard articulates in his study regarding the consumerism that plagues our society. The craziest part is how we fall for these manipulations time and time again. Many a times as a culture we can be very simple-minded, or even stubborn as we know what these producers are doing, yet we give in to satiate our own desires. "The Waste Makers" can also be tied to Thoreau's "Walden" in how we neglect that these material possessions will not lead to our happiness, but seeing others' facade of happiness through mediums such as social media makes us believe that happiness can be purchased. Christmas and black Friday are good examples of our consumerist society and how these producers have us on puppet strings. We turn holidays of value into events to splurge on items that are superficial. The blame is not all on the consumers, but the serpentine strategies that these producers use should be evaluated as well.

I agree with you, however I feel like in recent years as society has become more aware of the climate crisis, consumers have been disproportionately blamed in comparison to producers.

Reading Packard's book I actually started to feel like it's not just the producers we need to blame but all our societal leaders who have sold us this complete bullshit narrative of success and happiness. Growing up, I-along with most people--definitely believed at least some of it was true. My dad was born in Germany and has always rejected many quintessential American qualities (such as extreme consumerism), and my mom, growing up without a lot of money and surrounding herself with social work throughout her career also has many criticisms of our capitalist society. Any yet still, as a family, I'm seeing now that there are so many things we completely bought into. For example: why do we need four different cars (especially since almost none of them run properly?) Why does our house need three bathrooms, two ovens, and a huge fridge...? More importantly, why have I internalized the notion that "progress" and "development" are two necessary and crucial elements to a functioning society? The more I have learned in this class and others this quarter and last quarter, the more I have begun to doubt this engrained belief we hold that acquiring money, status, property, and items will make me happy in life--and beyond this, that these things are even necessary at all. At the end of the day, it all just feels so empty. And it is - when a house is so big you feel the need to fill the rooms with exercise machines and extra sofas and duplicate washing machines rather than living people, you know something is wrong.
<br><hr>
I agree with Lauren that merchants are getting their consumers to purchase more of their items through manipulation.  Capitalism has turned our economy into a baby that is constantly needing to be fed more and more in order to thrive. The postwar boom was a great way to meet the economy demands as well as the people's demands, however, after the need for stuff ended what were merchants planning on doing? I think that this is something that they did not take into consideration when producing more and more stuff. They just assumed that the people would continue to buy things and when they didn't they blamed it on a time lag and that eventually consumers would catch up.

    <br><br>

When merchants saw they weren't, they began to make superficial changes that would appeal to consumers and shamed them if they had an older version. This was evident in the change from a hand mower to a seated one. These companies and their greed made the American people buy more and more things that they might not necessarily need. Like Lauren points out, this is evident in today's Iphones, where a new one is released every year however, it is mostly the physical appearance that changes and not necessarily what is on the inside. Furthermore, companies are cheaping out on products so you will have to replace it more often.
    <br><br>


To a certain degree yes it is us the consumers fault more purchasing so many things but companies are also to blame. If you are constantly cheaping out on products then of course we are going to have to keep buying the item as needed. Furthermore, the need to fit into society pressures the younger kids to buy Iphones so that they aren’t made fun of for buying an android. We have become the biggest waste maker ever simply because the need for more and more money has become essential for our economy. The way we run our economy needs to change now if we want a better future for our kids.



<br><hr>
Lauren, I fully understand the anger you felt when reading about producers’ main goal of forced consumption. I too tend to fall for advertising tricks as a consumer, even though I know the items I already have are in perfectly fine condition. Something that has really helped me slow my consumption down is realizing my financial state as a college student. I don’t have the same financial freedoms that I used to, as I’m now responsible for essentially financing my life down here in Santa Barbara. Even though I’m only a first-year at the moment, next year I’ll be paying rent, buying my own groceries, and paying for gas for my car. Knowing this, it makes me really reflect on if I truly need an item before I go through with purchasing this. I think basically everyone could benefit from adopting this mindset, even if they’re not doing it for financial reasons. What really is the point of purchasing something we don’t need to purchase? A material item can only do so much for our happiness before we lose interest in it and feel the same emptiness we felt before, until we buy another material item and so on and so forth. Many people definitely tend to buy beyond the necessities simply to show that they can; after all, money is power. If your need to display power is contributing to the climate crisis, though, you really don’t deserve to have that power in the first place.

Planned obsolescence, which is what you're describing, is a disgusting practice that needs to be publicized more. Apple notably does this with its iPhone models, with the software and batteries becoming less and less functional with the release of each subsequent model. This, paired with its subtly aggressive marketing campaign, leads consumers to purchase the newest model every year or so in order to keep up with the latest/most functional technology. Packard talks about this theory more in-depth in chapter six, where he outlines the automobile industry's similar use of planned obsolescence. Although a bit outdated, all of his points are still relevant today. 

    <br><br>

As I've grown older, I've tried my best to abandon the consumerist mindset that corporations have fed to us since our generation was young. Desirability, as Packard talks about,  is what essentially drives the consumer's need to keep buying and buying. For the most part, I no longer feel that craving to always have the newest or greatest product to hit the shelves anymore. This mainly comes from the fact that I have come to terms with the fact that I am happy with the stuff I already have and don't really have a need to spend more unnecessary amounts of money in order to keep up with everyone else. In regard to your last point, I agree heavily that consumers need to become more aware of business practices. Although it would be desirable for companies to change their advertising practices, I don't think it could ever be a possible change.


<br><hr>
I was thinking the same. While I had always heard about America being a country of consumers, I feel like I have never really known what that means. I had never thought that consumption of things requires eventually throwing these things out. Similar to what you said about the new iPhones, I agree 100%. I am typically pretty conscious of the tech that I buy and I will easily shell out a few more hundred dollars to buy a nicer computer, because with computers the specs can be really important. With phones, however, I hadn't bought a new one since the iPhone 6s. I managed to put up with my terrible battery life until I lost my phone over winter break, and replaced it with the 11. If I hadn't lost it and the battery life never declined, I probably never would have bought a new one. The reason for this is that there's barely any differences between the models of iPhones. To make sure us consumers keep consuming, the phone is all one piece and costs almost the price of the phone to replace the battery. After hearing all the techniques marketing giants use laid out clearly, it's easy to see how much the iPhone fits in. Very little about each successive model is actually better in any way, just different-looking.

As the Waste Makers explains, most of the waste that we generate is not even necessary to maintain our lifestyle but is due to companies' needs to gain more profit than the previous quarter, and the desire for the economy to constantly be growing. 
     <br><br>

Packard points out the ways manufacturers and advertisers persuade consumers to buy things they don't need and didn't know they wanted, including the two-of-a-kind of everything syndrome—"two refrigerators in every home"—and appeals to purchase something because it is more expensive, or because it is painted in a new color.
    <br><br>
Very little products are sold because of their actual, natural demand. Advertisers convincing you to spend your hard-earned money for something you don't really want and certainly don't need. 
    <br><br>
The book also brought attention to the concept of planned obsolescence, in which a "death date" is built into products so that they wear out quickly and need to be replaced. The lifespan of products is also purposely limited to a short amount of time to create a constant need to replace them with new products.
    <br><br>
More and more people now are aware of the risks of our excessive consumption on the finite resources of our planet and the consequences of the increased waste. As consumers, we should decide what we need.





</p><br>


<p>
Reading "The Waste Makers" only solidified that the U.S. formed the economy based on consumerism. The Great Depression emphasized why spending money is so important for our economy, however this scared people into buying an excessive amount of stuff. Companies then exploited the American public into subliminally persuading people to buy more when unnecessary. It's truly frightening how impactful these companies can be to our buying decisions and attitudes towards items. What is considered "cool" or "expensive" is easily determined by the trends we see in production of stuff. An example of this in the text was compact cars. In the past, having a compact car meant you were not wealthy and that was bad, therefore everyone bought large cars. However when having a small car was acceptable, everyone quickly bought one. This didn't make companies enough money, so, not coincidentally, it only became acceptable to have a small car if the family also had a large car. 
    <br><br>

I was also disgusted by the last chapter of "The Waste Makers" that described how women are targeted in production because they are more likely to wear out a style in their mind. The text continued to mention how women would pressure their husbands into caring more about the way they dress. Sexism is so engraved into the United States that our economy depends on women to act like a certain standard. Overall it is horrible how far companies will go in order to further sales. It's also alarming how much the U.S. s accustomed to massive consuming.

I find it sad that in order for the economy to rise from consumerism something has to give. And that something is the current state of the Earth. Along with the boom of manufacturing came an insane amount of CO2 emissions. I wonder if in the future the future of economic stability will help the climate crisis and what that would look like.


<br><hr>
After reading “Making Waste”, I also thought this text only confirmed the strong reliance the united states economy has on consumerism. Possibly one of the most alarming things i learned that our perception of consumption experienced a shift after the Great Depression. Fear of a similar economic crash drove people and companies to consume and produce at record levels. It is at this point in time when companies began strategically targeting population groups from women to children. In addition it was at this point in time when companies began strategically creating products that were made to become obsolete or no longer desired by their purchasers. I also found it interesting that it was in this point in time companies began making multiple variations of the same product to take up more shelf space in hopes of catching the eye of a the consumer. 

    <br><br>

The strategies and methods these companies used was truly frightening, especially considering just how prevalent consumerism is now in our society. Reading this also made me think about the tobacco industry and how they would manipulate the perception of their product. In considering this I found there to be several parallels of regular everyday products and how they advertised in relation to the tobacco industry. Overall it was interesting to see how consumerism became ever so present in the everyday lives of americans.

"The Waste Makers" by Vance Packard brings up many clear points that I have never considered before. It makes sense that companies are promoting over-consumption because of how quickly they're producing their products and it's despicable that some companies try to deceive their customers so that they buy more items. One example in the book was the color of potato peelers being yellow or white, so that they blend in with the newspaper when cooks wrap up the peels and throw it away. This causes them to buy more potato peelers in the long run if this consistently happens. Reading this made me laugh a little! How could companies think of something of something so insignificant like this? But I have to admit it, they're incredibly smart for doing this so that consumers will keep buying more potato peelers. This continuously creates a cycle of consumerism and profit for the company.

I completely agree, the potato peeler section of the book was definitely sad, but funny. The levels that these companies stoop to in order to get people to buy more products is almost laughable. This isn’t a new issue though, and the reasoning stems from the overproduction of goods, creating a cycle of consumerism. Where companies overproduce, so they market them and make them cheaper, while they work on next year’s batch which will draw out the same people who bought their last product. Nowadays there is a definite consumer culture that is ever present within our society. What shoes you wear, what phone you have all say something about you. Companies have successfully integrated consumerism into the headspace of every consumer. “fans” will go out to midnight events and wait in long lines to buy the newest best thing. Whether it be shoes, clothes, phones, cars, computers, etc.… the consumers are never satisfied with the perfectly good items they have at home. They need to have the newest phone or clothes otherwise those around them will know. We live in an era of consumerism to the maximum, Packard alluded to this, but I doubt he would have imagined the techniques being used in modern times. With the invention and popularization of the internet, shopping has changed, people now have the accessibility and convenience of never leaving their houses and having everything that they want to be shipped to them. This accessibility has been a detriment to our waste of “outdated” items, we are going through products faster than we can buy them. It seems like almost every day there are new things being sold or advertised to us, the advertising is everywhere to the point where we don’t even notice it.


<br><hr>
Hello! I too found the example of yellow and white potato peelers very funny and also dumb (obviously not that dumb because it clearly worked out for these companies since it made consumers purchase more potato peelers) but just the idea of it seemed absurd. These companies are incredibly smart and know what they are doing and to think that they were already coming up with such ideas many years ago is quite impressive because they were only bound to go up from there. In today's time, these companies come up with even more mind blowing strategies to get people to consume more even when they don't necessarily need to. They don't care whether or not the public actually need these items, they don't care if they throw them away right after just one use, because that is the point. The point is for them to realize that they no longer need it, that they need something new and improved so they can buy more. It is a repeated cycle. Like Ken mentioned, “unchecked corporations are willing to do extraordinary things in the name of profit … even if it kills.” This is such a scary concept to take in. Packard mentions how Americans are the “most desiring people in the world,” and we need to start realizing this and stop eagerly consuming everything that is shown to us before it completely destroys us.

I really enjoyed this reading. While reading I felt a wave of realization. When you grow up in a time period when these manufacturing methods are already in place– and are seemingly just a fact of life– it is difficult to see how it became this way or even that it was so different just half a century ago. While I feel well informed about the ways of manufacturers, marketers and the like, this reading filled in the chronological and psychological blanks for me. I feel a bit annoyed, yes, of course, but I also have a sense of peace from knowing how this situation devolved in the way that it did. I hate it but at least I understand it more. I finally feel like I can see how it all snowballed: from boosting the economy, to keeping economically ahead of enemies of the state, to government officials inspiring the public to buy as much of they could of whatever they could in the pursuit of infinite economic growth– bigger is better, more is better. Going even further to find the greed that had developed within these industries as a result of rampant growth. Greedy people that began using psychological marketing techniques in order to ensure a growing economy. Crazy.

    <br><br>

The only thing that I didn't like was at one point when discussing obsolescence in the fashion industry, women wanting new dresses, it kind of implied that women were just as devious and tricky as the manufacturers/marketers– which in my opinion is lame. While blaming the designers, it blames women and while it describes men as "stubborn" it is seen as a less wasteful trait to have– waste being the issue at hand. Moving forward, there is, in fact, a huge amount of unsustainable and environmentally disastrous practices surrounding fashion. The fashion industry has incredibly advanced it's use of planned obsolescence of desirability, to not two seasons a year, but fifty-two. One a week. Insane, incredibly wasteful, and can have terrible impacts in other countries that we are purchasing goods from.

I also enjoyed this reading. I agree with you that it pointed the blame at women for wanting more clothes. I think that advertisements simply targets women more. It's the manufacturers that are to blame for women wanting more clothes. The marketers try to make women feel as though they need a new outfit for every occasion. They try to make it seem as if they need a particular item in more than just one color. 
    <br><br>
It's crazy to think that manufacturers use the same techniques today that they used in the past. For example, cars are still changed a bit every single year. They change the slightest details and everyone suddenly needs a new car and buys the new model even though there are barely any differences. The same goes for phones and other technology. Almost every year Apple releases new products and every year people trade in their older model phones for the brand new models. I find myself compelled to do this as well. Even though my phone is perfectly fine, I still want the new versions. The newer versions don't even have many differences rather than a new camera. I rarely ever use my phone camera, so why would I need a better one?


<br><hr>

I agree that this reading illustrated how our current consumerist society was made, a process which I also had previously not understood. Our generation grew up with this as all we know. It’s sad but the norm is being able to walk into any store and finding an article of clothing that you need for one specific event-- an item you will probably never wear again, and if that does not work you can simply browse from thousands of online stores and overnight ship something at your convenience. 
    <br><br>
The fact that certain clothing comes in and out of style every decade or so proves that this “fashion culture” is a complete illusion, set up by mass companies in order to make you feel less than if you have a pair of jeans that aren’t in style now, but were five years ago and will be in style five years from now. 
    <br><br>
I really liked that you pointed out how parts of this article targeted women, which I agree is very lame. Yes, some women might fit this standard, but to lump an entire gender together and say all women are like this is ridiculous. While we’re being stereotypical we could also discuss how men fall into this trend with new sporting gear, grilling equipment, or any other consumer product displayed as “mainly”-- and don’t even get me started about a mid-40 year old, white mans “my truck is bigger than yours” complex. Some women can fit into this stereotype, as well as some men, but not every single man or every single woman falls into the category of what society paints as “masculinity” and femininity.” Sorry for the rant, but you’re right Aubrey.



<br><hr>

I completely agree with the points you have made and feel like I also now have a better understanding of how we have turned into this consumerist society compared to how generations that came before us. I often find myself getting annoyed that people don't realize that extra material items and more things won't make them happier, but I would be lying if I never participated in our consumer society. It's difficult not to obsess over the newest iPhone or want the dress that's in style right now but we need to reshape our society and realize what we should truly value. The society we have grown up in pushes people to consume and consume items at rapid rates and then discard the items quickly and do it all over. We also believe that we must keep consuming to boost our economy and have a high GDP. I think that if we are to prevent any more damage to the environment we need to change our way of consuming items and recognize that infinite economic growth does not work on a planet with finite resources. 
    <br><br>

I also agree with your concerns about the fast fashion industry and its profound environmental damage. People constantly want the clothes that are trending or in style and look at these items with little respect to their function but rather what they are going to represent to others. The point you made about the fashion industry using planned obsolescence of desirability is totally spot on and explains how many companies are not making clothing to last but rather producing good that they know the consumer will want for a couple weeks or months while it's in style but will discard once a newer trendier item comes out. These items are usually low quality and unsustainably made and not only has negative effects on our planet but often the workers who are making these items in run down factories in third world counties.




<br><hr>
I enjoyed this reading as it gave me more insight into consumerism and how it has taken over our society. Although mass consumerism is terrible, this reading helped me understand why it became such a significant part of everyday life. This reading discusses how the 1950s was the start of when consumerism really began to take off. It makes complete sense to me that consumerism took off in the 1950s because prior to that the US faced huge economic downfall during The Great Depression. So it is no surprise that when the economy began to take off again people wanted to buy stuff simply because they could and because there was a plentitude of products to buy. It is crazy to me that consumerism is now seen as our economic duty to society, as President Eisenhower said in his annual economic message that prosperity could be sustained only if consumers-as well as management and labor-"perform their economic functions.". This mentality that we constantly need to be buying products has been ingrained into our minds and is amplified through the number of advertisements we see every day. I really liked reading about planned obsolescence and how companies are now wiring their products to stop functioning after a certain period of time in hopes you will buy another one. When I was reading this section I thought about Apple and how many products they have created from the first iPhone to the iPhone 11 pro max each one better than the one before it. I to feed into the mentality that you always want the next best thing and it’s a habit that I and the US as a whole need to break.

Packard’s The Waste Makers dived deep into the consumerism boomed out in the 1960s America, after World War II. He gives us his point of the origins of consumerism and the mechanism of it, how it works. The main reason for the birth of consumerism in America is probably the development of automated production. The factories are producing goods faster and faster while the consumers couldn’t actually buy that much - the supply outruns the demand. But in order to survive, markets must flow. So the president Eisenhower encouraged people to buy more. Then, there’s a series of the appearance of advertisements, encouraging people to buy more, even things they don’t really need. In the advertisements, people are informed things like “you can’t live without this new radio” or “with this product, you’ll be more complete.” In this way, products in the markets are sold. The main driver behind is probably the concept of “profit comes first,” economy is everything. Americans might be terrified by the economic recession in the earlier years and the void of the military industry in the age of peace. 

    <br><br>

I think it’s mostly the manufacturer’s responsibility to restrain the outbreaking consumerism. Afterall, they are the one who have abundant power to control themselves. Even though we, consumers are the one who brings profit for them, it’s hard to change the deepest concept inside our mind, for most people.

I agree with you, after reading The Waste Makers, it is still very relevant in our time today because of how the fashion industry’s marketing strategies has applied to other parts of our lives today. This is especially seen with electronics. Companies are designing electronics, such as Apple, to stop working and be less efficient over time so you have to buy their newer, expensive products. It sucks to see this because of how integrated phones have become into our lives, forcing a grip on consumers and putting people in unfair financial situations. To combat the climate change that is going on in our world, we need to address every issue that is holding it up. To deal with fashion and consumerism in general, specific resolutions need to be put in place for each place in the world to create a new global outlook on how to be efficient in life and for the planet’s sake. We also need to understand how the issue came into play for consumerism. I agree with you of how it really started with cars and how they produced so much supply they needed to increase demands while still being able to make products and make money from it. We have to change the mindset of how consumerism is not good, but bad for everyone who are not on the top of the hierarchy of consumerism. Those on top make all the money while everyone below them must chose their lives around how they feel and want to make popular.

Ken used the example of tobacco companies to show how corporations choose profits over the health of their consumers. This is honestly one of the best examples of how people/companies in power can truly do whatever they want and still get away with it, even now. Cigarettes were, for one specific American generation, “the cool thing to do ''. Alot of people, especially young people, smoked and it was extremely common.  Even now, if you ever visit Europe and walk into a restaurant, chances are you will see a sectioned off area inside the building which is essentially the “smokers room”. But the truth of the matter is that tobacco companies were hiding (from the 1920’s to the 1950’s) the fact that smoking cigarettes is very bad for your health. Think about that. That’s 30 years of smoking that could’ve been prevented or at least stopped prematurely. 
    <br><br>

I was especially depressed to hear about how easy it was for young children to recognize the camel symbol on the Joe Camel cigarettes. They could recognize Joe Camel as easily as recognizing Mickey Mouse, which is so sickening. The worst part is that you can’t stop advertisements and Joe Camel knew something about what happens when you hear/see something that is shown as “appealing” over and over again. You begin to think about it. “Oh, I’ve seen that ad. Maybe I should go try it?” And then , suddenly, you’re smoking cigarettes and it doesn’t feel that bad because it's so addicting. And this tactic worked. ⅓ of all cigarettes illegally sold to minors were Camels. That’s just sick. Those are your children you’re poisoning, but, of course, they don’t really care, they just want to make money.

Waste makers is a writing piece that shows how consumerism has evolved over the years. It talks about the great depression and the psychology of consumption today. As an econ student, I was fascinated, but as a climate crisis supporter, I was disgusted. I'm all for excessive income but not excessive consumption. The use of income has become out of hand, and the extreme hoarding of goods is repulsive. The American dream has been blown far out of proportion. Consumption in society has built on itself, and now we're at a point where acquiring goods will never satisfy us. In my life, it has gotten in the way of friendship, etc. out of high school, my friends got jobs, not high paying, but well of for a high school graduate. They ended up buying new expensive, flashy cars tying themselves down with a high monthly payment. That payment eliminated most of their income, and then they could barely afford to keep their lifestyle. They soon realized missing out on social activities to work off a car payment was not the way and that they should meet their necessities with slight luxuries in places they care about.

Like you are saying, consumerism has evolved over the years and it is so crazy to me to see the damage we have done in such a short amount of time. We as humans have single handedly created the largest problem that no other living thing could ever have come up with. Our greed is controlling the doom that we are facing and its mind boggling to think something we had control over, since we have created it, is going to destroy us. As you said, and we have talked about in class, we are acquiring goods every single day and are living for this idea of the “American Dream”, however it will never actually satisfy us. It is warped to think that everyone cares so much about having what is new and bigger and better, people get so caught up in it completely diminishes the actually important things in life. Not only does it diminish it but also it has changed our way of thinking to view these items as things that defines our importance in life.

    <br><br>

In the reading, he talks about how it is necessary that "the products that roll from the assembly lines of mass production must be consumed at an equally rapid rate and not be accumulated in inventories”. This challenged the public to always have a bigger appetite for products that would challenge these machines. Like ken says above this became the new normal and instead of owning things until they were entirely useless, people began consuming and discarding along the rates of what is trending. America really is a waste machine.

In Vance Packard’s “Waste Makers,” he makes corporations' destructive methods to draw in consumers clear to his audience.  In doing this, he outlines the strategies they use to motivate consumers to buy more through Obsolescence of function, Obsolescence of quality and Obsolescence of desirability.   It is incredibly apparent after reading this article that there are quite damaging motives behind how and why companies attempt to market their products around obsolescence.  At the time this study was written, these strategies probably did not sound as threatening as it does now.  However, due to the rapidly growing climate crisis, the damages of companies using strategies of obsolescence are incredibly threatening to our planet and should be met with zero tolerance.  Beyond the effects it has on the planet, the study also made me realize how businesses use marketing strategies to breed a population of greedy, discontented individuals.  If the strategies of obsolescence continues, this will only normalize a society of dissatisfaction and mass consumption.  It is also saddening to know that America was, and still is known for being one of the most greedy and wasteful countries in the world.  Before reading this study, I was confused as to why my family’s friends from Greece would be shocked at the sizes of things like our houses, cars and meals.  For my entire life, I found it completely normal to have two refrigerators, multiple cars, and large rooms in every house.  However, after reading Packard’s commentary on how people from other countries view American living conditions, everything makes a little more sense now.  In response to Ken’s question on whether the havoc wreaked on our environment is the fault of consumers or companies, it is more or less the companies that are enabling this normalization of disposable culture and rapid consumption due to obsolescence.

I agree with you, particularly when you said "businesses use marketing strategies to breed a population of greedy, discontented individuals." I have seen in my day to day life many examples of superficial, materialistic people who have been taking advantage of by these big businesses. These people are greedy, selfish, unhappy, yet they are wealthy and seem to have everything. This class is really making me feel that having stuff isn't always the best, but what is the best you may ask? Having happiness. Knowing these greedy corporations are singlehandedly destroying the world only makes me want to boycott, and encourage others to boycott, them even more. I agree with your position on Ken's question, that the corporations are more to blame than the people for enabling this normalization of disposable culture and rapid consumption. These corporations care more about making profit than protecting our planet and its inhabitants, because they know they have the money to avoid feeling the impact of climate change directly.

In one of my other classes, Industrial Ecology, we just discussed planned obsolescence. Electronic companies do a great job of implementing all the types of obsolescence into the same products. The iPhone is the perfect example. Each version is sleeker, has better cameras, more cameras, than the one before it. Each consecutive model has new features that make it more desirable than the one that came before. Everyone wants to buy the new iPhone. But even if you don't want to, you will. Because after a while the older, perfectly usable model  won't take the new software updates. And you need the software updates because all the apps you use run on that software. When the user doesn't get tired of the old model, the manufacturers help you along. 

    <br><br>

When it comes to getting rid of our old things, people choose from methods of storage, gifting, recycling, and disposal. Unfortunately, our throw-away culture means that much of what we don't want or need ends up in a landfill. Sure, if a table leg breaks we can restore it. But it is so much easier, even cheaper (when one factors in time and energy spent restoring it) to just throw it out and buy a new one. Everything comes cheap. Lower quality, sure, but it'll do if it's all we can afford. As a broke college student, I certainly don't want everything to be more expensive, but that seems the only way to change the way we see our Stuff. I know that if I buy a shirt for $30 I certainly care more for it than a shirt I buy for $7. I certainly hold companies responsible; in a bid to maximize profits, they cut corners and convince us that we need things that we don't really need and then they convince us to throw that stuff away. What we need are regulations. Companies equate the free market with personal freedom, but that is not true. Everyone who is not raking in the money of the masses suffers.



<br><hr>
I agree with your point that back in the day, around the mid 1900s the practices of businesses and corporations using strategies such as planned obsolescence may have seemed to be problematic as consumers seemed to be getting scammed but the environmental impacts of this kind of marketing practice are much more detrimental than just causing consumers to overspend. By designing products in a way where they either become obsolete in reality in terms of their function or in our minds due to new products and shifting culture companies are able to manipulate consumers and trick them into buying more frequently while discarding and replacing items at a faster rate. In addition, companies have found ways to build on industries by selling more and more accessories for products when markets get saturated and it is hard to come up with new ideas. When this happens, producers resort to wither just producing a newer version of a product and then portray older versions as out of date or they find ways to make consumers think they need more than one of an item or good. A great example of this comes from Vance Packard’s book as he described how people used to only own one pair of glasses or spectacles. But as the market became saturated and people already had their glasses, the companies started selling glasses and making them specialized to certain things so that one person would feel like they need different glasses for different occasions. One should then have a pair of reading glasses, outdoor glasses, sun glasses, computer glasses etc... . This promotion of over-consumption and throw-away spirit once a good becomes seen as old our out of date are critical in the ways that companies have been able to continue selling goods that are not integral to society despite a saturated market. I think that in order to solve the amount of waste that our economy produces as a result of these business practices, we need to understand that these strategies and tactics are at the core of our problem.



<br><hr>
In complete agreement with you, I am also convinced that companies are the ones causing the havoc wreaked on our environment, and they apparently just seem to be getting more and more corrupt. As their corruption increased over many years, companies and businesses have contributed a wide amount of this lack of satisfaction Americans have with almost everything. For numerous decades, people who migrate to the United States are convinced of this American dream supposedly made up of accomplishments, happiness, and simply an ideal lifestyle. In reality, this so-called "American dream" is unethical and depressing due to the fact that it is composed of a false conception of euphoria that was established by an avaricious population. 

    <br><br>

Our society has taken ambition and dissatisfaction to a whole different level. We have been convinced and trained to want the newest product, to want multiples of one thing, to compete with each other for "greater" things, to think "the bigger the better", to base our "happiness" on materialism, and to have this desire for so many unnecessary things with no meaningful purpose. We have been manipulated to live and falsely enjoy this amoral lifestyle with inaccurate perceptions of happiness.





</span></div><hr>


<p>
Again, this all goes back to older generations being the ones responsible for shaping our society in having this mentality of having to always buy the newest products. Many of us have been brought into this world of thinking that consuming goods serves our society a favor. Within Waste Makers, Packard addresses planned obsolescence being incorporated by certain industries so that they can make a profit from the goods they sell. It's a good marketing strategy from a business standpoint, we find it much simpler to discard old items that have gotten worn out then having to deal with calling someone to come fix an appliance item, we get rid of clothes that have gone out of style, or if we wear them once, we can no longer be seen in it. I used to be that type of person who would rather discard an item and replace it with a new one solely because I didn't want that hassle of dealing with someone having to come in to fix our appliances. I’d rather invest a few extra bucks for something that would last me so much longer than the average lifespan of that product, I would want the products I buy to be more durable, than having to replace my products every so often. Society has become accustomed to lazy attributes, we no longer think of how much waste we actually create and how much harm that does to our environment. We become brainwashed with these commercials in having to always buy more, and feel pressured to have to buy something.

I think it's interesting that you note how this article ties into Ken's point about the generational divide. I have actually been really skeptical about that divide, that there has been intent or purpose behind people in post-WW2 America's  negligence of the planet. This article shocked me. It's not surprising that we are wasteful now, I'm used to that. I'm used to social pressure to keep a closet of fresh, new clothes, to keep up with new tech, to have the most modern sports gear. what surprised me was how intentional it was. Sure, I know that the lifespan of tech is intentionally tapered (or at least not optimized), and sure, I know that fashion promotes quick turnarounds. It was just so surprising to me how old and well developed these ideas are. It feels so dumb to imagine someone ever needing two dishwashers, like the companies in the piece are promoting, but when I think about it, it's equally dumb to need more than a few pairs of shoes. 
    <br><br>


I think in the light of the environmental damage caused, maximizing profits is unconscionable. I think we need to hold companies to the same standards with their tapering of product life or their promoting increased waste as we do with those abusing workers. It's a bit dystopian, but ultimately, the cost of this profit is human life.

The word fashion made a lot of waste on the planet, but is it really necessary for us to meet the concept of fashion? I don't think so since there is a sentence around my friends saying that fashion is like a circle, maybe one day people are chasing the same wearing style as the 1980s.  In addition, because of fashion, many people will throw clothes that they only wore several times in order to buy a new one. However, there are so many children in other countries that even don't have cloth to wear. There is such a big difference between them, and people who buy new clothes often will not feel shame. Besides consumers that want to meet the definition of fashion, the companies also play a big role in making waste. Selling more things means more profit, and they only care about how much money they can make. Just like Ken said, some people even sell cigarettes to children so they can make profits. From my perspective, it is a murder. By letting children smoke when they were too young, it will harm their health badly, even will cause many reversible diseases, isn't it murder? I hope as time passes, the government can notice the phenomenon of making waste, and they can interact with it.



</p><hr>


<p>
It's pretty astonishing how much big corporate companies can get away with. When Ken mentioned tobacco industry "... even knowingly killing people by the millions", that really hit me. Like first of all, how could the people behind these companies live with themselves knowing that they were destroying the lives of their consumers? How can money be important enough to someone for them to do that? Also, why are they even allowed to do this? I cannot believe that an industry could get away with selling product that will inevitably harm the consumer. The fact that they advertised to underage children is atrocious. Unfortunately, these companies got away with it and set a precedent for other industries to follow suit, like the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry, like the tobacco industry, knowingly put their consumers in harm's way for profit. Unlike the tobacco industry, however,  the fossil fuel industry not only risked the health of their consumers, but all of the life of the planet. Again, it amazes me that they were allowed to do this. It amazes me how much of an impact money has on people's sense of right and wrong.

In the Brave New World, Huxley deliberately depicted what could happen if mass consumerism erodes people’s thoughts and behaviors. This aims to provide a warning to the public to pay more attention to how consumerism would affect our life and our planet. 
    <br><br>

As it is said in the book, “It is absolutely necessary that the products that roll from the assembly lines of mass production be consumed at an equally rapid rate,” our society is literally run based on consumerism. And in our daily life, the commercial companies also try to apply different marketing strategies to promote people to buy more. The potato peelers are always made in a neutral color so as to promote the consumers to replace them frequently. This also applies to mobile phones. The longevity of the battery of mobile phones is severely decreasing, and this forces people to replace their phones as the speed they replace their clothes. In the society where consumerism is flourishing, we, as the consumers, have to develop the consciousness of avoiding unnecessary purchase and purchasing less.

This reading really highlighted to me the fact that the environmental issue is more of an economic issue than I initially realized. I learned that companies sixty to seventy years ago would use what are to me unacceptable sales tactics to make more money. They realized that they were hitting a wall in terms of profits and the only way they would be able to get over it was by They would advertise to people by basically saying "you already have this product, but you need another one" or "this product is newer and better than the product it is replacing". 

    <br><br>

I am less concerned with those tactics to sell more than I am by the quality of the goods these companies have produced. They stopped caring about the consumer, so they started making cheaper products to turn higher profits. These cheap products would break, forcing the customer to buy another one. The worst part is, companies are still doing it to this day. Recently, Apple was found to have been slowing down old iPhones and intentionally slowing down the battery life so that people would be forced to buy a new phone. When I found out they were doing this, I was infuriated, as I was having trouble with my iPhone's battery and, luckily, I was able to go to Apple and have them fix it for cheap. 

    <br><br>

I think more blame has to go on the public than we realize. We are the ones buying these cheap products and falling for phony advertising. We need to buy less or even boycott companies that do not make products that are up to our standard. Ultimately, the big companies rely on us to make money, so if we stop buying, they will have to make a change.

This is true, since the 1960’s America has been putting economic needs over environmental ones. In the 1950’s when the recession occurred, President Eisenhower proposed buying more materials as a solution to mend the recession, “Buy...Buy Anything”. Whether this actually helped the recession or not is not important. What is important is the action citizens took after hearing him say this. Businesses started using this as an advertising tool to get people to buy more, and it worked. People were buying things they didn't need and didn't have money for, in efforts to help the economy. Before encouraging citizens to buy without purpose, the government should have considered how this would harm the planet. They should have thought about how much unnecessary waste and production would arise from this. Just as Brett stated in his comment, the public today is still falling for these ploys made by big companies. Companies are trying to make more and more money, and political officials are letting them, as they tell the public buying their things will help the economy.


<br><hr>
I agree with you in some sense, but disagree in others. I think it was smart of the government to convince people to buy things during the recession because it would help the economy. Buying and buying was probably the main reason that the recession came to an end, and I think that doing anything else may have jeopardized that result.
    <br><br>


However, I agree with you in the fact that companies were irresponsible when they continued to tell people they needed to buy more even when the recession had ended. A lot of companies claim that their products are saving the consumers, but they are not putting their money where their mouth is, as they are making shopping an drug that is very addicting (Ken even said something in lecture about "highs" people get when they go on a shopping spree).

After reading “The Waste Maker,” I came to a realization that the rise of consumerism is constantly pushing us to feel dissatisfied and resulting in a vicious cycle of produce, purchase, and waste. It is scary to think that every single one of us is contributing to today’s trillion-dollar economy of incredible consumerism. Even more shocking is the fact that our motive, our choice, and our action are actually being manipulated by the companies, which are the producers. It is those producers who deliberately bring forth the idea of “planned obsolescence,” who purposefully induce people to buy new things by making them feel that the old items they owned were already out of fashion. As a result, we gradually developed this endless desire of ownership, by which we could never feel contented with the things we own but always looking forward to buying new things to fulfill this endless desire. Sadly, this is me, as well. I am also one of the many people who have been manipulated by the producers to become waste makers. As a person who is constantly browsing makeup & beauty related websites every day, I always managed to keep up with the newest beauty trends by purchasing those newly released merchandises. Little do I know that it is the companies who would deliberately advertise for a new product in order to make us feel that it is a “must” to own this product in order to become a trendy and fashionable teenager who lives in this modern 21st century. It surprised me the most when I learned that there are 52 fashion seasons in a single year. This is just insane. There is no doubt that this reflects our consumerist culture right now, which greatly differs from the conception of consumerism from our parents’ generation. For them, the motive for buying new things is mostly because of the dysfunction of the old items. However, for us, our motive for buying new things is simply because of its trendy attraction. Unfortunately, this culture has already become so dominant that it is hard to really make changes, especially for young people like us. As a result, I believe it’s time to put greater emphasis on education, which would be a helpful start to re-establish our twisted conception of what it means to buy things.

I was also completely shocked that we are being grossly manipulated by these companies into buying more and more products. The part that made me the most upset while reading “Waste Makers” was learning about planned obsolescence. I have always known that things, especially when used frequently, don’t last forever, however it was shocking to learn that these companies play a huge role in purposely creating products to no longer be useful in about a year after use. After reading about the tactics of “planned obsolescence,” I also quickly realized how I have been manipulated into becoming a waste maker. For instance, if there is anything I buy I the most in this world, it’s socks. Socks for myself, socks as a gift, fuzzy socks, thermal socks (I think you get the point) -- I need it. There hasn’t been a time that I walk into a target and not leave with at least a pair of socks for either myself or to gift someone. Now, do I or the other person need the socks? Absolutely not, but I am so conditioned into purchasing meaningless things that I do not need to the point that buying a pair of socks because they are season related (i.e. Christmas socks, Valentines socks, etc.) is natural to me. Just as you mentioned in your comment, I buy not out of necessity, but rather a “trendy attraction.”


<br><hr>
I agree with you. Major companies are constantly associating consumerism with happiness in their advertisements when the case is that consumption does not buy you happiness. People often discover that but at a point when it is too late and they are already consumed with consumerism culture. This era where we are currently living in is interesting because the new normal is simply normal. Meaning, we are constantly reaching for new things and discarding things alongside with it. This was not a problem a hundred years ago where people would be used to the same normal for quite a while; what happened in between? The garment industry is a cruel business because of this new culture that they have imposed onto the public and the treatment of their workers in third world countries. Thoreau saw the fashion industry for what it is and no one listened. We need to glorify a lifestyle that encourages people to buy new things every now and then; not every week or so. At the rate at which we are constantly producing, we cannot keep on consuming and throwing away waste because of how degraded our planet already is.



<br><hr>

I totally can resonate with the part where you talk about teenagers incorporating fashion as their own identity and how these firms are crazily making 52 seasons in a single year. This is not just unreasonable: it is a cultural and environmental disaster. These consumerist doctrines are deeply implanted not merely by these firms but also by ourselves. I'd say that enjoying material goods would seem the ultimate destination of this ruthless society. But what we as human could make out of this crazy consumerist culture? Are we making the artificial "God of fashion" by our hands and crazily dedicating to it with religious fever.



<br><hr>

I agree with you about the terrifying repercussions of our consumer culture. I am guilty of browsing online sites for new clothes, better makeup, or getting excited when I see something that looks almost identical to something I already own but is newer. Something that makes me think that we have these reactions to new things is due to our insatiable culture; it is instilled in us from a young age to become discontent and crave new or more or different. It was even instilled in the populace during the recession to "Buy. Anything." It scares me to think we are constantly consuming  and constantly producing, in a never-ending cycle until we reach a threshold, if there even is a threshold. The comparison of overproducing goods to an "over-kill" by overproducing hydrogen bombs is too much for me to wrap my head around. If we continue to produce more and more, then we will soon run out of resources. We do not need this much stuff. I was shocked to read the statistic that the U.S. is out-producing Russia 20 to one. Since taking this class, I have already noticed a change in my perception of buying new clothing or goods. An emphasis on education would significantly help re-establish the world's perception of consumerism.



<br><hr>
This is disgusting. This specific concept was something that never came to mind until I read these chapters of the book. I had always known that people were being pushed to buy the newest and best things, but I never thought of the fact that to achieve this, the producer must make the item irrelevant in just a short amount of time. Not only do the producers do this by making people feel as if they need the new item through appeal, but sometimes people are forced to get new items, even when they would prefer not to. 

    <br><br>

For example, when people want to buy the newest iPhones that come out every year, not only are people buying the new phone because they want better features, but they are buying new phones because they know that their old phones will no longer function after a few years. Personally, I am one to use my phone for as long as I can, however, after a certain amount of time, apple stops offering updates for old devices, and soon enough no apps or other devices are compatible with it, so I am forced to buy a new one instead of keeping my old one for longer.
    <br><br>


I would have to agree that this mindset will be difficult to change because this is something that is just part of our nature now, and something that I hadn’t even really realized until it was being directly explained to me. I think implementing a new mindset in our education system is a great idea, but unfortunately seems like an unrealistic one.

I agree with you that consumerism is pushing us as a society towards a dissatisfaction and often a depression caused by that discontentment. It's a sad fact of life. And it's really not that new. Even in biblical times, Jesus talked about the difficulties of being a rich person and living a life of fulfilment. And that of course seemed radical 2000 years ago and it still hasn't seemed to stick into the inherent culture of the human psyche. And of course, with the first sentences of the second chapter of The Waste Makers, we're faced with a staggering statistic that we are consuming twice as much in goods as we were 75 years ago. That's a single lifetime. The exponential surge resembles that of Carbon emissions and I wish that there was any semblance of a curving any time soon but our fate looks grim. And it feels hopeless when all the power is in the hands of the big corporations and not the consumers. We lean towards education to be the salvation from ourselves when, in this case, we must make our own rules and reintroduce and repopularise boycotts. We need to be able to overcome the disgusting lust for stuff and perhaps move towards minimalist lifestyles. And believe me, it is just as hard as it sounds. I really appreciate your comment for discussion of the roles that corporations have on the brainwashing of it's customers.

I agree with your comment that we as a society are stuck in this constant cycle of consumerism that is endangering our planet. Big corporations who depend on the rise and fall of trends are contributing greatly to the climate crisis by insinuating that people need to buy more new and flashy things to fit in with a society that is ever growing as well as changing at a fast pace. I believe our society should do more to normalize a minimalistic approach to living and to value each materialistic item a little more than the last. By settling with what we have instead of constantly wanting to change up the items we already own, we as a society would be able to make great strides towards becoming more environmentally friendly to our planet. Another problem our society has is associating items with happy or sad emotions in the form of attachment. Although never living things, people tend to form emotional connections to inanimate objects which makes it harder to let go. These attachments to inanimate objects arguably cause people to want more and more things in order to fill a void in their life. Unfortunately, this is a wasteful approach and is killing our planet at a fast rate and big corporations and people need to realize the impact mass consumerism has on the well-being of our planet.

I also thought the concept of "planned obsolescence" is just inherently terrible and certain producers should be ashamed of how they approach it. Of course, I understand the main objective of a producer is to make more money and sell more stuff. However, I think the particular practice of obsolescence of quality is a truly abhorrent if seen from an objective point of view. People are deliberately sabotaging their own products so that people come back and buy more of it. Such a process is increasingly more common in modern society, which is even more concerning for the general consumer. Just a few years ago, Apple was sued for the intentional degradation of their old iphones in order to encourage the purchases of the newer, more expensive model.
    <br><br>
The process of obsolescence of desirability, which you mentioned in your comment, is also quite despicable when all things are considered. Yesterday, before my midterm, I stopped by the arbor and saw a new, brightly packaged hot cheeto bag labeled "dynamite". Unfortunately, my mouth was filled with the upmost disappointment when i bit into one and realized it was literally the same flavor as the preexisting "Hot Cheeto Puffs". As a result of the corporate mentality, we only accrue more and more waste, degrading the integrity of both our lives and the environment.


<br><hr>

I agree with you. I constantly find myself online shopping to check what's new or whats the "hot new thing" that everyone is getting. With the internet making it so easy to constantly be  buying new things, I feel that I'm constantly looking for that instant satisfaction of buying something new. Also, I find myself tracking that package until it arrives and when I receive it, it almost feels like a gift and I get way too excited. With social media too, everyone is posting their newest outfits and it makes me want to buy even more stuff. Companies post on instagram "Go check out whats hot!" or "New Arrivals!" to suck us into buying something new every time they release a new product.If I go somewhere for one thing, I usually end up leaving with 3 other things that I did not go there to purchase nor do I need.  I'm always trying to keep up on the trends which is so pointless because at the end of the day it doesn't mean anything. But sadly, this is what our consumerism culture has led us to.



<br><hr>

I agree with you. I totally agree with you. I am also one of the people who have been manipulated by the producers to become waste makers. Before watching the film, I didn't notice we are manipulated by these companies to become a consumer and then a waste maker. I love online shopping and browsing makeup and clothes websites. Sometimes I know I don't need new clothes or makeup, but I just can't control myself to buy those stuff. I think online shopping is also a strategy the producers use to make us buy more. Although I have to admit that online shopping makes our life more convenient, it also makes us buy more and waste more. We don't need to drive to the mall or wait until the weekend to go shopping, with online shopping we can easily buy stuff by clicking on the keyboard. "Planned obsolescence" is another strategy the producers use to induce people to buy new things by making us, the consumers, feel the old items we have are already out of fashion. This tactic is especially useful for teenagers who have a strong sense of vanity and want to be cooler by having new sneakers, cell phones, or cars. In my opinion, the problem of wasting resources should be both consumer’s and producer’s fault. We as consumers should have rational consumption rather than buy whatever we want even though it is useless. Producers should focus more on the environment than profits. They should produce what people need rather than induce people to consume more.

By reading the lecture, there is a long history of consumerism in the United States since the World War Ⅱ. Consumerism is the invisible hand behind the economy that push a nation to operate. That is the reason marketing and advertising for companies to approach its customers, the main goal is to MAKE THEM BUY THINGS. For instance, a supply chain of a new car model requires hundreds of suppliers from raw materials, production, transportation etc. to finally reach a store floor for presentation. Salesman will introduce persuasive stories with details behind the designs, material use, functions, horsepower etc. of this new car model to finally make consumers to hand in their credit cards. The whole process creates job opportunities and consumptions that related to a nation’s economic credentials. Moreover, people need to consume things for psychological needs such as recognition. I agree with the author that fashion is one of the most influential drivers behind consumerism and I already see many examples that women shouted “there is nothing to wear” while they have three drawers of apparels like new. Fashion bonds tightly with social recognition and cultures that seems inseparable.

Although consumerism is what saved the nation's economy and created the capitalist system we are so familiar with today, there were many side effects that resulted from this movement. Fashion is only one of the many wasteful ways consumers contribute to the climate crisis, whereas food, electronics, forms of transportation, and things in general are equally as destructive to the environment. Looking at the consumer boom in the 1940s from this viewpoint, it is safe to say that the world went too far in mass production.

This reading was very intriguing to me because a few years ago I realized how Apple makes phones deteriorate after a few years so you buy a new iPhone that costs even more money (and is now above $1000 which is insane).  I connected this idea to "The Waste Makers" because many large corporations only care about profit rather than taking an environmental approach. They see the end goal not as creating sustainable products that are durable and will be good investments. Instead, they desire money and creating new models of the same product for their own selfish purposes. This is extremely frustrating, especially as a student, because I feel like I am forced into buying products I don't even need. This idea of planned obsolescence is described in this reading and shows how companies do whatever it takes to get their main goal -- profit. 

    <br><br>

The fashion industry is the most wasteful industry in the world and "The Waste Makers" talks about this deeper. Although I knew that the fashion industry uses smart tactics to make us believe we need new clothes, this reading showed me the scientific side of it. Fashion companies make us believe that our clothes are out of date or not "cool" anymore, so we feel like we need to buy the new clothes. We end up having so much unnecessary items in our closet that we end up throwing away usually (rather than donating or giving to friends/family). I personally have so many clothes in my closet that I never wear and just take up space, and I remember different instances where I felt like I had to buy certain clothes to either fit in or look pretty etc. Looking at this from the environmental side of things, we can see how wasteful this industry truly is and how important it is for us to not fall for their tricks. Young people especially need to understand that buying more clothes is just contributing even more to climate change and we can find more sustainable clothing companies instead that don't make us believe we need new clothes every month.
    <br><br>


Overall, this reading shows us how corporations and big companies advertise in ways that make us think we need new of everything. This especially began happening in the 1950s when consumerism in America took a turn for the worse. One part of this reading that really stuck with me was the lawn mowers. Advertisers made Americans feel like it wasn't cool to push a lawn mower, so they must buy power-mowers instead. Then, they made Americans believe that power mowers with seats were the new and cool product to buy. These changes ended up in immense profit for the corporations but for the normal Americans made no sense. Everything increased in price when there wasn't an issue to begin with.

I agreed with much of what you mentioned in your comment. After doing the assigned reading I was able to see pretty much the beginning of where today's American consumerism began. Much about what the book spoke about you can relate to today's market and advertising, and you see how easily the consumer falls for them. In today's society as you mentioned fashion plays such a big role in this wasteful mentality. We are constantly hit with different types of advertisements promoting fashion trends and products. Not only are we sold the product but we are sold the mentality that we absolutely need these products in order to "fit in" and be a socially accepted member of society. After the reading I tried to reflect on how I might have fallen into these advertising tactics and I find myself relating to your mentioning of the iPhone. Growing up and seeing Apple come out with a new iPhone or tech, and seeing everyone do whatever they could to get one. Personally I would see family friends pressure their parents believe that they desperately needed the new iPhone to fit in school and their parents would do their best to get it for them even if it included getting in debt with telephone companies selling them and charging them ridiculous amount of interest. I feel that this type of mentality really plays into this whole idea of the "American Dream," from the reading you read about mainly the typical suburban family but it doesn't really mention the lower class and how it affects them. Reflecting on my life and being part of the "lower" economic class growing up, the "American Dream" for me was being able to have the money to buy myself all these luxuries and items that honestly you don't truly need. Achieving the "American Dream" means being part of the wealthy class and buying multiple houses, cars, and all type of clothes, and from this you are able to see that because of this mentality and everyone striving to achieve this living, that it is exactly the opposite of what we must do in order to lower our carbon footprint. Through this article you are able to truly see the beginning of the U.S. culture of consumerism, and how that has played a big role in climate change.

I also was taken back by the history of American consumerism and the idea that their only main goal is profit. I think it is sad that we as a society are so brainwashed that we think we need to buy new clothes and dispose of the old at such a rapid pace, especially because it is costing Americans more money which just goes into the pockets of big companies. I wish that we could all wake up and reuse the clothes we have and stop producing so many unnecessary items. 
    <br><br>


I also think it is crazy that it has been seventy years since the world wars and this started the consumer change. Packer's "Waste Makers" says that consumerism is a waste machine and Americans consume more which wastes more. I think it is also crazy that at just a young age advertising targets our minds and tries to use classical conditioning to get us to all think a certain way.

The statistics presented in Vance Packard's "The Wastemakers" are stomach-turning to say the least. It is quite unsettling to learn that the average U.S. citizen is consuming 2x as many goods as in pre-World War II years, that 1 in 6 families were multiple car owners by 1960, and that the average U.S. family spends $500 a year on packaging alone. These chapters reveal many of the cunning ways companies, manufacturers, and economists have psychologically manipulated the public into an epidemic of wastefulness. I found the implementation of psychological obsolescence to be particularly fascinating. Marketers were really able to convince the public that durability was out and the "throwaway spirit" of disposables was in. Interesting that when demand for goods were dipping below output, their reaction was not to simply lower supply and save money in manufacturing, but instead to coerce the public into utterly wasteful, gluttonous, and unsustainable ways of living. Conjointly, deeming these horrible methods socially justifiable because they 'redistribute wealth' is so not even coming close to understanding the problem and the magnitude of what it would take to make these actions 'socially justifiable.'

In Vance Packard’s article “The Waste Makers”, he mainly talks about overproduction after the WWII. Because of overproduction, overconsumption is inevitably. People always pursue the brand-new trend that will consume a lot of materials. For example, in the industry of fashion, so many people included me will buy lots of “popular” clothes every year. However, after a year, even several months, when these clothes are off-seasons, people will seldom wear these clothes, and the shopping mall and stores will not sell these clothes any more. It forms a big negative circle of material consumptions. Not only in the fashion industry, overconsumption also appears frequently in the food area. Many instant food that can cooked by microwave are costs too much in the package. And many students like me and busy workers, they do not want to cook or do not have enough spare time to cook. They will choose instant food and cause too much package consumption.

I think it is incredibly interesting, and also terrifying, that corporations have been so successful in psychologically manipulating us that we will willingly throw out a perfectly good product for a new and improved version that is more “in style”. I think that all of us would like to think that we are smarter than letting these corporations trick us, but we have all definitely fallen victim to this and will continue to as “better” and “more improved” products hit the market. In most cases, the products we are replacing in our homes and lives are just as good and useful as the new ones we are buying. That's what makes the psychological abilities of corporations so scary. As noted in the article, one of the largest obstacle’s corporations face is trying to convince us we need a product we do not actually need. Most corporations have been very successful at this. They have essentially brainwashed into believing our lives are not complete unless we have the best things. This mindset has been building in citizens since the 1960’s, and it has now become our reality. It is going to be very hard to stray away from this habit, because we have become so accustomed to it and companies have found very successful ways to manipulate us.

Going through the reading was truly fascinating. I was fascinated at how gullible our culture is. This made me realize that the stores we buy our products from have been cultivating our utter demise since the great depression. The advancements that we’ve grown accustomed to having in our homes are really just luxuries that we’ve been brainwashed to think that we need to have by corporations. Do you really need two refrigerators in your home? Or a toaster that produces all nine shades of toast? In any case, I think that both the reckless corporate side and the consumer are to blame for the ugliness of consumer culture. 


<br><br>
A quote that really stuck to me from the reading was that “The changes that were being brought in the laboratories frequently were simply superficial changes and improvements that could be used as selling points by copy writers” (Packard). This showed me how wasteful we are as a society because not only do advertisers take advantage of the consumer culture, but we are still relentless when it comes to shopping. If we see a new version of a product on television, we instantly grow a distaste for the outdated version of the product we already have which was the whole point of the people who made the ad. They want people to keep up with the newest trend. This is they key issue for consumerism. It is a problem that causes a cascade of events that are extremely harmful for the environment. A change could be so simple as a new version in a different color that will catch the eye of the consumer to get rid of the thing that is sitting in their home that is perfectly fine. And that’s just it. The “getting rid of it” is the most crucial part that we need to think of as humans who live on this planet: where does everything that we throw away go?  It was really interesting how the reading brought up how wasteful aerosol cans are on both the consumer and producer side. The producer puts food in them and designs them to run out quickly but the consumer still opens it (which is really unsafe) to find more food in the cans. Those consumers who don’t open it just throw the cans away and continue to buy them not realizing the extremely harmful effects aerosol cans have on the environment.

I was really interested in your comment. I agreed that our culture is very gullible. Our cultures is focused on easy access to goods and is focused on the fancy extra things rather than necessities. we like thngs with fancy functions and cheap prices makining more waste and relulting in products that are completely useless for the future. The quality of our items dont allow things to be resused and the price of the products we buy harm the environemnt all while being completely useless.

I agree with what you comment on. The book reveals that consumerism and materialism are extraordinary brainwashed many Americans. And people keep buying clothes, cool cars, and accessories crazily. I can relate this phenomenon to China, too. On the Chinese social media like Weibo or Tiktok, a large number of beauty bloggers or vloggers are making videos to sell their cosmetic products. There is a popular saying that girls need to makeup and we make up for ourselves to enjoy life. In fact, making up is a personal choice and you cannot brainwash every girl in order to sell your products and make money. A lot of girls are now fascinated towards cosmetics and fashion. They use a large amount of money every year to make up and to buy nice clothes. I believe every one of them ignores their spirit or I can say wisdom. A lot of them do not buy a book even in a year to cultivate themselves. I mean that we can buy cosmetics to make us more beautiful but we cannot be controlled by cosmetics and these sellers.

Capitalism is the best and the only practical way to benefit society or people as a group. Capitalism always accompanies consumerism. The consumption of the good is the most important part of the close cycle of capitalism. More consumption means more production. More production stands for more jobs. Thus, the economic can works in an upward, positive loop. For the developed nation, like the USA, the reduction will not only affect the domestic economy but also will affect the economy of the developing nation which may cause them to die due to the shortage of jobs. 
<br><br>


The current world is really complex. When we tried to achieve a goal, the process may affect a lot of people in a lot of aspects. There is a balance point of protecting the environment and developing life quality. However, in this balance point, the environment may still get worse. This is just a no-solution question.

To put into words the idea of buying new versions of items that are very similar to ones already owned is “planned obsolescence,” something most consumers in a rampant consumer society fall victim to.  In this week’s reading, “The Waste Makers,” I found it very eye-opening for the information presented about things I did myself, but had no idea was being manipulated to do by fashion companies and consumer industries alike.  I had to sit there and ask myself, did I really need to buy the latest version of any of my electronics?  A new blue denim pair of jeans?  My previous pair were just fine, just a little faded and not as “on-trend”. The answer is no, I didn’t have to repurchase any of those things, waste my money on replacing something that wasn’t obsolete.  I felt as if this week’s reading’s left me a little more knowledgeable to my unnecessary and wasteful habits.

I think more than anything, the most infuriating thing I’ve read so far is not the conditions we’re living in, not the climate deniers, but this. What’s infuriating about this reading are the tactics that marketers and salesmen in industries use to somehow manipulate the way people live. The greed for money clearly wrecks havoc in this reading as it doesn’t take consideration for the consequences of what this consumer culture they’re promoting is doing for the wellbeing of humanity of the environment. 
<br><br>

This greed goes as far to attack humanities vulnerability and deepest insecurities to force them into thinking that consuming more would be the solution to their problems. However, it merely did the opposite and made people afraid to even be vulnerable again. When the reading discussed how the fact that Revlon convinced women that they needed to match their nails to their mood so that they would buy more. It’s infuriating to hear that they don’t think planned obsolescence is planned waste. I literally can’t wrap my head around the idea that it somehow helps stimulate the economy. It does raise the question though that if we don’t consume more, how do those in factories survive or maintain their jobs? 
<br><br>

We’ve become pigeon holed into this type of consumerist lifestyle, how do we as individuals get out of that when we feel so confined to these restrictions on how we must live our lives? This was ultimately a good reminder that what we can do is to be cognizant of the things we’re buying, to make our items last longer, purchase only for necessities and quality that won’t break or become undesirable.

The Waste Makers satisfy their desires by buying more things, but the effect is short-lived. They will show off their new purchases and get so-called happiness from them. I think it is a kind of addiction, unable to control their own desire, although it will not harm themselves, but very bad for the environment. With the development and progress of modern science and technology, various electronic devices emerge one after another, and the replacement rate is very fast. Businesses upgrade one or two features at a time and raise prices to make more money, and make people feel like they're getting their money's worth with fancy advertising. But most of the features are beyond people's daily needs, which is a huge waste. We need to learn to be satisfied and use less.

After learning everything we have in this class, the climate problem always seems to come back to humans’ selfishness and constant need for new goods. However, after reading this I gained some insight into how it’s not the consumers’ fault, but instead a lifestyle that has been ingrained into our heads since birth. A part of Wastemakers that stood out to me was the comparison between our consumerism society and the society in Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. That novel is a supposed glance in our future, where nothing matters except for consuming and disposing. There, kids are taught that “ending is better than mending”, which is very comparable to the world that kids here are introduced into. That line, is basically blended into the never ending commercials for endless goods that could satisfy any needs. 
 <br><br>
Our endless consumption and waste of goods is not the consumers’ fault. It’s the big producers and advertising strategies that have created us into ignorant, destructive monsters who abuse the resources earth provides for us. According to this book, companies purposefully create strategies to manipulate consumers and basically force them to buy the newest produce through sly, scheming ways. An example that stood out to me was how a company created potato peelers in colors similar to potatoes to promote the accidental act of throwing it away, on purpose. Companies like these purposefully want to create waste, to promote the selling of their products. In this situation, the consumers should have zero blame as they were just an innocent pawn in this master scheme of consuming and wasting. 
<br><br>
 Without these strategies to get people to consume more, the earth would be much more well off. However, our economy would be nothing compared to what it is now. My main concept taken from this book was that the economy will only work if we destroy the environment. To keep our growing economy, people will have to buy 50% more. This means 50% more resources used and disposed of within a couple of years. The prosperity we experience is only because of the degradation we put the earth through. To save the earth and to prevent the continuation of this route, we would have to reshape our whole economy and basic consumerism.

I strongly agree with you that, especially after reading Thoreau’s Walden and watching Ken’s lectures on electric automobiles and air travel, it always seemed to be that our individual choices out of desire for material goods was the main reason we are contributing to the addition of waste. However, especially after this week’s reading and film, I am more aware of the active role that producers have in creating waste during production as well as their success at promoting a certain lifestyle dependent on consumerism. 

<br><br>

One of the facts that Packard points out that struck me the most was that the average person began working fifty-three hours longer in the late fifties to buy even cheaper models of automobiles and the upkeep of their cars. This perfectly exemplifies how our lives are centered on this consumer lifestyle, even willing to give up much of our time and money to do so. As Packard points out, the desire for goods was not keeping up with productive capacity as Say’s Law claimed, ultimately igniting the producers’ involvement in the consumer’s thinking. Interestingly enough, producers refuse to bring this problem to the attention of the consumers and even promote the internal constant need for stuff by altering their own goods.


<br><hr>
I also thought that the main cause of the climate crisis was people being selfish and buying more than they need just for the sake of buying new, better, and “cooler” things. However, the second chapter briefly mentions that Russia would not be able to catch up to America’s manufacturing industry. While the competition between countries is not the main focus of the book, I still think it is a huge part of our consumerism lifestyle. We grow up learning from history textbooks that the Industrial Revolutions were one of the greatest and most monumental things that happened. It led to economic and social success, and it also allowed America to climb its way to the top of the world. We grow up believing that buying things makes us as individuals more successful, but also the country more successful. That is why most countries in the world try their best to manufacture more and more things. In today’s terms, the more you make, the more you buy, the more you spend your money, the more successful you will be.

In Vance Packard’s, “The Waste Makers”, he discusses the different effects that consumerism has had on our environment. I think something that Ken brings up, and that is very related to week 4’s topics, is the idea of fashion, especially the continuous upward trend of fast fashion, Packard discusses the development of fashion and of supply and demand - how some companies will have a specific quantity of a style, and the week later, they will cut up the remaining product that was not sold so that no one else can have it, which incentivizes people to stay in-trend and be aware of how fashion works so that they buy things from week to week in fear of missing a specific clothing item that could potentially present itself as desirable. 
<br><br>


Today’s waste of materials and this pump of constant production allows for suppliers to increase demand and motivates them to make more, which utilizes all of their resources. However, what we fail to realize is that this idea of consumerism is due to the large contribution from which the ideology derives: consumers. Packard goes into depth on this phenomena, describing how the newest fashion, automobiles, and technology - the desire for the newest, best, and greatest invention or item - fuels our climate crisis. 

<br><br>

I remember having a discussion with my friend a day before the iPhone 11 was announced to the public. We were looking for the cases that manufacturers made in preparation for it.I looked at my current iPhone (that year's make), and my friend - who had a phone that was much older than mine - was ready to purchase the new iPhone. As we were walking down the aisles, we started to talk about why people would want to purchase the new iPhone, how Apple’s marketing schemes highlight the new, and what the appeal is of buying one each year. In the midst of that conversation, my friend told me something that I will eternally ponder when discussing technology, especially Apple products - “the second the newest iPhone comes out, that technology becomes obsolete.” Everyone will then look to the next model - one that has not even come out yet - and forget that the one that they hold in their hand exists. 
<br><br>


That idea - the philosophy that once something comes out, it is automatically obsolete to the potential products - is subconsciously in the brain of millions of consumers. And, is there something inherently wrong with that? If they choose to spend their money to stay up to date, are they feeding into immorality? Directly, no. But, what people do not understand - and what Packard helps to point out - is that there are background, indirect, and unintentional consequences when we buy products.

Ryan you bring up a lot of interesting points about our current consumerist culture. Your personal example with your friend and the iPhone is an interesting take that adds to the discussion we should be having about our goods consumption. The idea that we need certain things, or that we should want certain things is being artificially manufactured by the companies that want us to consume--- after all, what use are we as consumers if we do not consume. I also personally struggle with wanting the newest shiniest thing: be it the new iPhone, a new pair of jeans, new headphones, a new car, etc. 

<br><br>

Reading Vance Packard’s “The Waste Makers” opened my eyes to a lot of interesting points. I learned that even as far back as 60 years ago (yes 1960 was 60 years ago now), progressives were critical of our defense spending. Packard decries “the massive and crucial … defense spending which has reached fifty billion dollars a year.” Additionally, learning about government propaganda encouraging the populace to spend money served as a good way to learn about how our current consumerist culture came to be. I found Packard’s commentary on how companies began selling minor improvements in the stead of major advances to be enlightening. Discussing Say’s law and its fall to irrelevance was an effective way for Packard to explain how rampant production is compared to consumer need. By using that analogy it becomes clear that “need” is being manufactured and that we don’t truly “need” this excess of goods.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with all the points stated. Especially about the iPhone, when they released iPhone 11, all I could think was "why would anyone need 2 or 3 cameras in one phone?" and I found it ridiculous that majority of my friends were so excited to get the new release. Because you are right, as soon as something new is dropped the past ones just become out of date. It's sad, how in this society if you have to have the newest iPhone, a collection of $100+ shoes, a chain necklace, expensive clothes, etc. all to be considered "cool" or to "fit in." How did we get to this point? 
<br><br>
I assumed this was a new society problem, but after reading "The Waste Markers," this issue of consumerism has been happening for years and years. Companies taking the simplest thing and creating a new technological advancement (who needs a toaster with more than 5 buttons?) or making the consumers buy more by saying that they can't buy one item without the other. We get trapped into the corporations marketing skills that we don't think about how unnecessary these items can be, nor the environmental impact it has on this planet. 
<br><br>
This is just makes me wonder if our society will ever change? Is there a chance for us to not get caught into the advertisements? Will corporations ever stop taking advantage of their consumers? I'm just not sure, we can easily change our lifestyle as a society.

Your comment is comprehensive and your analyze is thorough. First of all, you summarize what Vance Packard said in “The Waste Makers”. According to you, Packard “discusses the different effects that consumerism has had on our environment.” Also, “Packard goes into depth on this phenomena, describing how the newest fashion, automobiles, and technology—the desire for the news, best, and greatest invention—fuels our climate change.” In addition, you mention your discussion with your friend about buying new phone in order to exemplify the idea that “once something comes out, it is automatically obsolete to the potential products.” Millions of consumers have this idea in their brains subconsciously. However, people do not notice the phenomenon. So they don't pay much attention to it and cannot understand the bad influence of it. Packard points out these problems, and his book is helpful for us to understand these issues.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. The obsolescence of products is a big problem. However, I believe that this problem is the least of our worries, as it is something that has a simple solution. 
<br><br>

In "The Waste Makers", Packard states that 2/5ths of the average person’s possessions are not essential to his/her physical well-being. They are optional/luxury items. He also states that the amount of goods and services that one man can turn out in an hour has increased about 3 percent every year. This increased output can be absorbed if each citizen consumes more, or if there are, each year, more citizens. Otherwise, there will be less work. The challenge of finding significant improvements is becoming more difficult. Therefore, companies need to advertise their products more frequently and more intensely in order to retain their customers and maintain their businesses. 
<br><br>

This might all seem like a big and scary problem, but I find it easy to combat. It all starts with changing the way we think. Firstly, we have to be able to recognize companies' manipulative tendencies. They claim to satisfy appetites we don't really have, and we must learn that they only see us as dollar bills. Secondly, we must resist the temptation of shopping "for the heck of it". Thirdly, we must understand what we need, so we can shop efficiently and purchase objects that are reliable, long-lasting, and valuable to our lives. And finally, we must learn to appreciate what we have so that we can hold onto those objects and prevent the desire for newer, unnecessary ones. Only then can we make a change. If we buy in more minimalistic, intelligent, and environmentally-friendly ways, you might think that companies will go out of business and the economy will suffer; however, that is not the case. By changing our buying habits, we are shifting the flow in our capitalistic society. When it comes down to it, we have the power. It may not seem like it, as big companies are always preying on our insecurities and tricking us into thinking that we need their products to fill voids in our lives. However, when we change our ways of thinking, we change the world. We prevent those companies from persuading us to buy their breakable, eco-unfriendly, desensitizing, wasteful, unreliable, and short-lasting products and we force them to provide us with good objects that we will actually support and purchase. How do we do that? We simply stop buying those bad products. Our entire economy would change for the better. Instead of competing to make a better looking phone or a car with more buttons, companies would compete to make more long-lasting and environmentally friendly products! Companies would change to please their customers because without their customers, they have nothing. We can't sit around and wait for something to happen. It all starts with us.

Packard's book "The Waste Maker" does a brilliant job at explaining the origins and development of the American consumerist-driven mindset that we see even today. I especially enjoyed reading his take in Chapter 5 "Progress Through the Throwaway Spirit". In this particular chapter, he mentions how, in the early days of American settlement, people highly valued their goods, and preserved them for as long as they could. They didn't seek to buy or make new goods, and they never wasted anything. If they couldn't keep something, or it absolutely had to be replaced with something else, they would auction the used goods off and find a new home for them to be equally treasured and preserved. Packard then proceeds to point out how marketing and the media now push the consumerist agenda down the throats of Americans, and Americans eat it up. Any minuscule "innovation" or change in a product equals the mass disposal of previous version of aforementioned good in exchange for the "improved" version. 
<br><br>

I find this comparison interesting particularly because of how it clashes between two very different perceptions on what it means to be American. In the early days of the country, Americans valued their few possessions, and understood that you don't need a lot to be happy, be successful, and thrive in the blossoming country. Even up through the early 20th century, most Americans still didn't believe that you needed to overindulge on new material goods on a regular basis in order to feel happy or satisfied. But now, as a result of Depression and its huge economic sore, Americans are known around the world as being a consumerist and materialistic society, where bigger is better, and more is better. It's amazing seeing how quickly our society shifted from against the regular purchasing of new goods simply for the sake of buying new things to actively promoting and encouraging the lifestyle of excess.

I also found the book to be very informing about how our origins of our consumer culture, and for me I could never imagine not having "American consumerist-driven mindset". I feel as though the public is very susceptible to what is deemed cool by others and therefore seems to follow what others think. We want what is considered the best, what is innovative and makes life easier but to think that there was a time in which the opposite is true is fascinating. The drastic change really points out what the difference is between the two times of culture. However knowing that large corporations sent out encouragement to the people that we should want more minuscule improvements, and what we have been doing with things discarded just shows the laziness of our culture as well. My grandma does this thing that I never truly noticed, if something I had would clothes that would rip and I tried to throw it away, she would then take it and try to fix whatever it was. 
<br><br>

There is immense irony in the differences between the two perceptions of our country. We do not value our possessions as much due to our mindset of "everything can be replaced" and it does not only monetarily effect how we value things but also effects our Earth and waste. I also feel like the idea of consumerism relates to the idea of the American Dream, we have the "power" and "money" to not care about what happens to our planet and the waste we contribute. As much as I wish it was not true, we really are one of the largest sources of materialism and the constant pressure that we add to others makes our ability to turn to our old ways practically impossible.


<br><hr>

Packard’s book was, indeed, an interesting read. I thought it was well written and did a great job explaining the exponential growth in consumerism over the past century. I agree, Alexa, that chapter five was a good chapter as it showed the progression of American values. Once upon a time, people made purchases of necessities. These items were used until they physically couldn’t be used any longer. This is like the jacket example, where people would buy a jacket and repair it once it was worn out. Now people buy five jackets and wear them until they are no longer desirable to wear.

The business industries have changed consumers tastes and values as every week new trends and items are released. These businesses market their goods by making previous items look out of style and undesirable. Consumers have become materialistic. 
<br><br>

I think this is a result of World War II, in which the United States economy expanded. The US has experienced phenomenal growth since that time, although there have been some recessions. It wasn’t until around the late 20th century in which consumerism sky rocketed. We now see most items as disposable and are quick to replace them with the newest and trendiest thing. Examples of this are cars and technology. Every year when Apple releases a new phone, consumers go wild, waiting in long lines and quick to discard their previous phone. Along with that, every year car companies release new models and people instead of using their already owned cars to their full potentials, buy newer/more stylish cars. I’d agree that we live in a society where we promote being on trend and living in excess.

I, too, though that this comparison between the America of the past and that of today was very interesting. The idea of planned obsolesce in the consumer culture we live in has completely changed our ways of life, and no one seems to mind. No one asks where it all goes afterwards. People see what is in front of them, and what is in front of them is the wasteful consumer culture that companies have shoved in their faces on billboards, in ads, and everywhere they go. It’s almost unbelievable to think that Americans were once so frugal and appreciated each and all of their possessions. This seems to all tie back to fossil fuels that have allowed for the faster production of these wasteful and fruitless goods. As you mentioned in your comment, much of this was a snap back from the Depression and a want of daily goods. 
<br><br>

Industries further their benefit off of people and the Earth with no regards for the detriment they cause. As Ken stated in his video, “Time and time again corporations have chosen their needs over those of consumers… often ending with horrific results.” The greed that our consumerism driven society has inspired is literally killing people (eg. the tobacco industry, and of course, climate change). Also, the book details so many psychological tricks that companies use to further consumerism. It’s a positive feedback cycle that uses resources and trashes our Earth and hurts our communities.




<br><hr>
This book was a very interesting read for me and I too had the same thoughts upon reading the chapter where Vance Packard talked about how in the past, people were not wasteful at all and tried to preserve their goods for as long as possible. This is so different from our capitalistic and consumeristic society that we currently live in where every new change is something that is promoted and advertised to the public to buy. One classic example that I can think of is the Apple phones. Every year, Apple pushes out a new version of a phone that is essentially the same thing as the last one except with a few more features that is just enough to excite the public into trading in their old phone for the newest, most modern version. This is something that happens every year and not something that is necessary nor is it helpful for our environment. However, it is true that we as Americans eat up this form of marketing and work to get that new and improved version instead of just sticking with what we have until that dies. 
<br><br>
Now, in our materialistic society, I feel as if we have shifted to this new mindset to get the best version out in the market although it is not something that we necessarily need. This is extremely disappointing because these are things that we simply desire and I too am guilty of doing this whenever I see the next trend in the store, I feel as if I have to get it and wear it because of the way that it is strategically marketed. We need to work to not be victims of this materialistic mindset and instead, stick with what we have and be happy with it.

Consumerism is a huge part of our society today. We are living in a world where we believe that our only happiness comes from what we own. This mentality was created by the very people that sell us these goods. They build off of our need to be better than those around us by selling us things that supposedly elevate our status. We buy more and more and feed into their villain plans to make money off of us. When I was in high school, my friend and I would go shopping every time we were stressed about school or life. I knew how unhealthy this habit was then for my emotional wellbeing, however I never realized how unhealthy it was for the environment. Learning about the cycle of consumerism has made me feel like I have been conned. Advertisement propaganda and the american dream are just lies fed to the public. Very 1984 of them. We don’t really realize how much of our lives are influenced and even controlled by companies and other outside forces. Even when reality is thrown in our faces many people push back. They don’t want to believe that their free will is a farce. But really who led you to believe that you needed a smart phone or new stylish clothes or a nice car? Did you decide on your own that these were the things you wanted to spend your life's savings on? Or were these false images of happiness stimulated by consumerism thrown in your face and shoved down your throat so many times that it became the only thing you believed?

Many fear that the American habit to consume cannot change without having drastic effects on the economy. Thus far, our economy has been driven by our dedication to the consumerism culture that’s been created and bolstered upon us since we were kids. As kids, TV commercials and the easily breakable toys we would play with have subconsciously taught us that everything is temporary and replaceable by something newer, bigger, and better. Due to that, we’ve lived our whole lives in ignorant dedication to consumerism. But what would happen if we had a significant cultural change away from consumerism? I don’t mean to sound in support of the consumerist culture that has managed to leech into every part of our lives, but I can’t help to think that consumerism plays a major role in upholding our society as we know it. Doesn’t it make sense to think that a decline in buying would make our economy tank, sending us into another recession? And if we stopped buying goods, then their need to be manufactured would also decline, meaning millions of jobs would no longer exist. So what solutions are there to slowing consumerism without completely ruining our economy? In chapter two of the reading, Packard mentioned that even the slightest mention of U.S. Government cuts to defense spending consequently translated to a drop in the stock market. But what if the government allocated more of their money into clean and reusable energy efforts such as solar power or hydropower. Would this put enough money into the economy to keep us from a recession? And consumers could opt for buying reusable products or at least cleanly made products instead of “single-use” items. Although in terms of the big picture, I am just not that optimistic that our economy can survive a steep decrease in consumerism.

Consumerism is absolutely dominating most of Americans’ life. Before reading “The Waste Makers”, I believed that consumerism was solely caused by people’s jealousy. However, now I realized that there are more factors that are responsible for the consumerism lifestyle. 
<br><br>
One factor is that when there is profit, there is always a market, regardless of the externality. Like an example that Ken mentioned in the lecture, long after tobacco was introduced into the market, people started to realize that tobacco is related to lung cancer. The tobacco industries should have taken the responsibility of amending people’s health problems due to smoking, but the reality is that they continue to produce tobacco and the tobacco market grows rapidly. The fashion market is the same. Although most people are not gaining real happiness from pursuing the latest fashion, including clothes and automobiles, the demand in fashion market never decrease. Therefore, famous brands and car industries keeps on developing new products, not worrying about how much carbon they emitted. 
<br><br>
The other factor is the US government who started and advocated the lifestyle of consumerism. During the recession, the government wanted to boost the economy by encouraging people to buy things, “Buy to prosperity.” Although the economy did recover, the policy introduced consumerism into the society. Admittedly, consuming is a good way to help the growth of economy, but it is not a sustainable lifestyle to recommend.

I totally agree with you. Although people know that smoking tobacco is likely causing lung cancer, their desire of consuming more and buying more is always exists. Consumers nowadays are so easily being attracted by advertisements. As a result, they would willingly buy products introduced by Ads, and throw them away after buying brand new products. Companies which beneficial from those consumers are not only draining consumers’ money, but resources on the earth. As you said that they should take responsibility of their carbon emission which I agree with you the most. However, consumers should be educated to buy less and consume less. They should realize that how much carbon dioxide would emit to the atmosphere if they buy those products. This could be a possible way other than order companies to produce less while raise public awareness of protect the environment.

Reading "The Waste Makers" almost caused me to have an existential crisis. I think the part that really got me thinking was when the book made a comparison to Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World." In this novel, people are taught at a young age that "newness is a trait to be cherished." People need to be attracted to new things in order to adapt future demand to the future of an industry's supply. Similarly, "The Waste Makers" also describes how children's worlds are filled with cheap plastic toys that often break so that children are taught at a young age that everything in this world is replaceable. The thought of comparing our society to this dystopian one got me thinking about free will, and how the members enslaved to these dystopian societies don't have it and neither do we. 
<br><br>


When I think about the reasons why I buy new things, it makes me realize how ridiculous the actuality of it is. Right now, I'm taking notes on these lecture videos in multiple different colored pens. Why do I have multiple different colored pens? Well, compared to "boring" black these colors bring me joy. But why does having an out-of-the-ordinary product bring me so much happiness? I began to realize through my own choices that like everyone in today's society, I've been brain-washed. Having something that is new is exciting because we're taught that things that are used too much become obsolete. All of this is taught and ingrained in our culture by industries who want to sell more products. All the things I have in multiple colors, the whole idea of matching clothes to jewelry, and to nail colors, and to makeup is all a construct to buy more and more things. This increased want, this capitalistic ideal that we need to consume more things is created by the industries in order to keep us in a constant state of discontentment until our disposable culture ultimately ruins us spiritually, and environmentally.

Consumerism isn’t helping anyone. It is a culture that makes people more and more discontented with themselves. As Thoreau explained, having excess things will only drag us down. Everyone needs to slow down and consume a little less. Adapting a full minimalist lifestyle, while ideal is totally extreme. Baby steps like thrifting and not supporting fast fashion are super important. Although stores like Forever 21 and H&M are fun and easy, people need to be reminded of all the greenhouse gases emitted and unsafe work environments that are put into making those clothes. It’s accessibility is not worth it. “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was a major wake-up call for me. I already donate my clothes to places such as IV Trading Post and thrift with my friends, but I am guilty of shopping at Forever 21. I’m going to make more of an effort to shop locally and support local artists.

This reading almost made me confused about how gullible some people are. Could someone really be convinced to have two refrigerators in their house? Or two sets of washers and dryers? Now some of the other things I could see people buying to look “fancy” but I think it’s ridiculous some people buy two refrigerators. One for drinks and one for food? I can’t really wrap my head around it but of course, people will come up with an excuse to buy anything if it makes them look better, even if it’s something stupid. 

<br><br>

The act of buying has been pushed onto us by businesses so they can make better money. If we just ignored them, we could save money and the environment. But businesses have made it seem like if you don’t have a bathing suit for the morning sun, noonday sun, and the evening sun, you’re doomed and will never be happy. We see the happy faces in the ads and think maybe we can make ourselves happy by just buying whatever the person is selling. It might work for a little bit, but after a while, you’re bored again and just want to be happy, therefore repeating a cycle that will never end. I hope one day, people will realize this cycle and push themselves out of it, not only to save themselves but also the environment.

Hi! I was also thinking about how crazy it sounds to think that people would buy two fridges or multiples of washers and dryers. Do people really do this? Then I thought about the multiple huge houses I have seen of different TV shows and remember they have a couple of fridges instead of just one. I think this is just another way for people to show how well off they are, how successful they are. With that said, I also agree with you in that it is not really the buyers' fault, because they are being pushed by businesses so they make more money. I also hope that people will realize this cycle and put a stop to it. But for the time being the best we can do is try and educate more people about this issue and the problem of consumerism culture.

Packard does a really great job of explaining how the United States has fallen into an overpowering consumerist mindset and the various ways in which the production industry has maintained our desire to continuously buy more and more "stuff". Though this piece was full of extremely interesting examples and information, what I found to be the most interesting and honestly, a bit mind blowing, was the various tactics different companies and industries used to keep the public wanting more. I was extremely surprised at successful companies were, according to Packard, when they decided to sell the same product in a variety of different colors. The fact that in the fifties, Revlon "taught" women to match their nail polish to their mood, and therefore they were able to sell far more of their product is honestly a bit comical. Similarly, the  different color for each room approach made me laugh to myself a little, because you'd never think that a tactic that is so simple and materialistic would be so successful, but it was, and arguably still is today.  One thing that has definitely not changed that Packard also brings up is the sheer greed of many companies to the point where they care only about profit, and not at all about the customer. The fact that a company selling potato peelers purposefully painted their peelers to very closely resemble potato peels in the hopes that the consumer would accidentally throw it away and buy another is pretty evil, and there's no doubt that there's many companies who use similar strategies today.  I think that while Packard did a good job at informing the reader about how our society has become so materialistic, I'm left wondering how we can change this ideology and this want for more and more stuff, or if it's even possible at all.

I agree with the idea that Packard thoroughly explained that the United States has “fallen into an overpowering consumerist mindset.” When I was reading the article, I could not believe that companies had such vicious intentions and in a way were tricking the public. Once companies realized that the average American had all the essential appliances and did not need to keep buying the same technology as: refrigerators, stove tops, and cars, they started creating slogans to make people believe that their appliances are old. Companies created advertisements to make Americans feel as though they need to buy the latest appliance if they didn't want to feel poor. For example, if one didn't have the newest electronic lawnmower with a seat that cost about x10 more than the original lawnmower, they were seen as poor. Companies are taking advantage of people and creating a materialistic society. Packard mentions that once people ran out of new inventions, the idea of using colors as a tactic for more consumerism was forged. I also thought it was despicable, as you mentioned, that Revoln “taught” women about matching their nail color to their mood. I never thought about how every item in the world is used as a tactic for consumerism. I like painting my nails with multiple colors and I never tied this to corporate greed of products. During recessions, slogans were created at high speeds for people “to buy, buy!” and were emotionally manipulated to think that the recession was because people were not consuming enough even though there was such a high rate of overproduction.

<br><hr>
I agree that this reading did a good job at demonstrating just how we got into this horrible “disposable” lifestyle. I had never really thought about how it happened, I just knew it was a problem. Learning about how it happened aggravated me more and made me disappointed in the morals and values of corporations and industries. When it comes to developing the same product in different colors and convincing people that they needed multiple in various colors is manipulation of the public, influencing them to buy more. Even today people believe that having a bigger house, multiple cars, a powered lawn mower, etc. makes them better and ranks them higher up in society. These thoughts didn’t just come out of thin air; they were purposely put there in a sneaky way by industries and advertisers. I found it extremely disappointing to read that car developers were purposely decreasing gas mileage from 20 mile per gallon to 15 miles per gallon just so people had to buy more gas. Instead of using innovative thinking to make things more efficient and environmentally friendly, those values were disregarded in order to earn more profit. 
 <br><br>
The tactic that I found most. frustrating was the throwaway spirit. People were encouraged to buy everything that was disposable. Single use things that could be thrown away right after you  are done with them. These things were advertised as more efficient and easier to use. Nowadays, luckily, a lot of people are focusing on doing the opposite by eliminating single use, disposable items from their lives and instead using reusable items like tupperware, hydroflasks and cloth grocery bags. It is so much cheaper to buy things without the disposable aspect of them. Like Packard mentioned, salt in small, throwaway containers is seventeen times more expensive than salt bought by pound. This is where these industries are making their money and why they don’t want to stop using disposable products. 
 <br><br>
I too, am having a hard time seeing this ideology and structure of economy changing. We can only hope that people, including the people leading our country, wake up and see climate change as a real, urgent situation that must be dealt with on all levels, even if that means reducing the number of cars and houses we all have.


<br><hr>
I agree with your claim that the United States has fallen into a consumerist mindset. It is interesting to take a peek behind the curtain of corporations who are only trying to sell and sell. Like you, I was mind blown when I read about the attempt to get people to buy more stuff by convincing them that differing colors is an important factor. Like yourself, I’m left wondering if there is anything that we as consumers can do to change our ideologies for the good of the environment. Unfortunately,I think that if we do happen to catch on to these tactics that corporations use to sell more, I feel like they may be too smart and simply do something new and different which will still yield them similar results.
<br><hr>
I also found the tactics that Packard described to be kind of comical and surprising. The scariest part about all of it is that most consumers have no idea that they are becoming a sort of brainwashed by advertising. Companies will hire psychologists to help them come up with the most profitable ads that trick the minds of consumers into buying more stuff. Even if you are aware of this it is still so difficult to not subconsciously buy into it. Something shocking to me in the Wayback Machine was the part when Packard mentioned that president Eisenhower, in response to people asking how to solve the recession, said “Buy. Buy what? Buy anything”. The fact that our president was encouraging an unnecessary consumeristic mindset to solve a huge issue is astonishing. I remember learning in U.S history that in the 40s/50s people started to have disposal incomes due to industrialization and other societal factors. Because of this, companies saw an opportunity to make money and encouraged people to use their disposable income to buy things they didn’t need. I think that's where it all started, and since then it's just been snowballing and eventually, it will crash. I think the only way to solve the disgusting consumerism in our country is to create more laws that limit production from companies and force them to use more environmentally friendly manufacturing. In addition to this, we should educate people more about consumerism and how they are being tricked into buying things. Its probably impossible to ban advertising or even limit it, so the best way to solve that is for people to limit their children's exposure to advertising.

Vance Packard's "Waste Makers" was quite the interesting read, especially since so much of it is still true to this day. In the very first section that we are assigned to read, he begins by arguing that we as a society have the capability to produce much more than we actually need. This creates the dilemma where we are inefficient in terms of our output, so there are only a few things we can do. 1) we can sell to more people, 2) we can sell multiple products to the same people, or 3) we improve the product every year and the consumer will buy because it is better. In the 60 years that has passed since this book was published, the marketing strategy has not changed from these core fundamentals. Companies like Apple and Microsoft will continue to update their products, convincing consumers that the improvement is so necessary that you must buy it. Additionally, it becomes a status symbol to have the nicest, newest things, but in a world of rapidly evolving technology, this only feeds the consumerism that America faces today. Apple even offers plans to pay monthly and always have the newest phone, when in reality such a device could last 2-4 years without much trouble. Another big point that Packard argues for is "planned obsolescence" which is still seen today, if not in higher abundance. Products are designed to be use and throw, not designed to be renewable and durable. Things as small as chairs to even things as expensive as cars will be designed with the idea that in the product's expected lifespan, it should be used enough to break and the consumer will come back for another one. Whether it be batteries that lose potential charge over time, or furniture that uses cheaper materials to encourage wear, planned obsolescence is all around us. Thats why, in my opinion, much of the consumerism that America faces is built upon a company's ultimate goal to make a profit, especially in such a free market as exists in America. The lack of regulations and penalties that American corporations have to deal with is truly amazing, with many companies being able to get away with things like unfair wages, inhumane conditions, polluting the environment, and so much more.

I agree with you on the fact that a large part of American business is based off of profiteering in the sense of manipulation and indoctrination. All these marketing and cultural strategies that are used to induce people to buy more have worked on the American population and subsequently have created this American mindset which emphasizes the need to constantly buy things as a show of status. What I found interesting about the book was the embedded concept of the American's duty to buy more things. In one of President Ike's press conferences, he exhorted the American population to buy more to help fuel the economy. This notion of consumerism as an economic powerhouse turned into a justification of a wasteful practice. It's a misconception that people still use today to measure the wellbeing of the economy. Every time I go to the mall with my mother, she remarks on the fact that the mall is so busy and then goes on to take this as a sign that the economy is doing well instead of seeing it as people making wasteful decisions on things that they don't necessarily need.  
 <br><br>
What astounds me is the lack of morality that goes into the consideration of the design and production of these products. Everyone is always talking about corporate philanthropy but no one talks about corporate honesty and responsibility they have to their consumers. I am by no means talking about customer service. At. the end of the day it's just shameful that our economy and the American mindset is fixated on consumerism.


<br><hr>

Packard's arguments about overproduction in order to make a larger profit has been part of American culture and the American dream. The unchecked consumerism that has become central to the American economy has been perpetuated with the help of the free market. In order to reach a point where overproduction and consumerism are not central to American ideals, there needs to be a cultural shift. This cultural shift will be difficult to achieve because a central ideal of the American dream is to be able to buy bigger and better, to have enough money to buy the best for oneself. Although this ideal has been ingrained in everyone, actually being able to achieve the American dream is not as feasible as it was made out to be. In order to afford those large and unnecessary purchases, people are now working longer hours to be able to afford these expenses. More often than not, people are working longer hours in order to survive, not to make unnecessary purchases. But, people are working longer in order to purchase more than they need because it has been marketed to them that they need it, that that product is a necessity and they must have the newest version of it.

I had similar sentiments towards the reading for this week. Out of all of the readings that we have done so far, this one has been my favorite to read. It was extremely interesting to dive into the true reality of our consumerism culture in America, and how it has been building up for years. Even though Vance Packard wrote Waste Makers in the 1960s, it still feels extremely relevant to today. Chapters 2-7 of the book explains how our economy has become dependent on the growth of consumption and the multitude of ways in which advertisers and manufacturers have developed ways in order to maximize that consumption.  One quote that really stuck out to me was the epigraph of Chapter 2, a quote by Ernest Dale, that states, “Marketing men across America are facing a fact that is hard for them to swallow. America's capacity to produce may have outstripped its capacity to consume” (10). This quote perfectly describes what our society has become. With improved technology and manufacturing processes, we are able to produce way more than demand can meet, so new techniques are needed to convince people to buy more, even when they do not need to. The above comment points out some ways in which companies have done this, such as Apple coming out with a new phone every year or so. One that is more expensive yet includes some “upgrades” that convinces people to get rid of their perfectly working phone in order to get the newer model, also known as planned obsolescence. Products are no longer made with the idea being that they are durable and long-lasting, instead, they are made to be used up, thrown away, and replaced so that the consumer has to buy more. I like how the above comment points out how this is all built around the concept of corporations wanting more of a profit. It seems like they barely care about how the product will benefit society, and instead only focus on how they can sell more and more, creating more and more waste.

I don't think individual Americans are to blame for the vast consumer culture we have today. It is obviously the companies' fault. They've created so many stereotypes and ideas in our heads to get us to buy whatever they want us to buy. For me its really interesting to think about the fashion aspect of products and how it's really "psychological obsolescence". When I was younger, my dream was to become a fashion designer. I thought fashion was about being creative and expressing oneself, and yes to some extent wearing/designing clothes is still an art, but I can't help but think about how the idea of fashion and having different designs was for the purpose of companies making more money. I have always appreciated the growth and history of fashion but this book has really got me thinking about the underlying truth. I  recently watched a video about fast fashion that said that specifically selling boys/girls clothes was an idea created by companies for increased profit so families wouldn't hand down their clothes to each child, boy or girl. That's crazy to me, gender roles have been a very big problem throughout history and the gender norms of clothing were literally created by a company. Most of the societal norms we have are created by companies through advertisements. McDonalds has boy or girl toys. Nickelodeon has Nerf gun commercials with boys but separate advertisements that obviously target girls. Companies are subliminally teaching kids that they have to want/like certain things because of their gender. Not only has consumer culture contributed to the climate crisis but it also contributes to bigger societal problems that never really get addressed.

Nowadays, commodity consumption per capita is twice the average consumption per person before the WW2. However, as the consumption ability grows, 2/5 goods people are not necessary, and some of them are luxuries. Such growth is driven by capitalism’s conspiracy, such as marketing strategy and planned obsolescence, instead of growth of people’ demand. 
 <br><br>
A modern marketing strategy is to sell things in pair. Taking deodorant as an example, merchants design one for male and one for female, thus a nuclear family has to buy two different deodorants instead of one. However, they actually just need one because there is no difference between the male and female deodorant except slightly different smell, while they function in the same way.
 <br><br>
On the other side, business uses planned obsolescence to stimulate people to consume. It’s an interesting fact that the rate of product replacement is fast, especially electronic devices, but new products only improve on the small details. According to Webster Dictionary, out of use means obsolescence of function, desirability, and quality. In this case, people’s desirability of new product is exuberant. Hence, they will buy new products and replace the old one as soon as they are published, which means they are creating more wastes than before. It seems that the consumption ability goes up. But, it that really needed?

You are absolutely right about the point that merchants from the end of last 50s have used a lot of marketing strategies to stimulate American consumption. As automated equipment were introduced, " American capacity to produce may have outstripped its capacity to consume." Every social class has been appealing to grow consumption, in order to follow the enormous supply. Honestly, as an economics student, I learned a lot marketing strategies from this article. For example, updating the product appearance or some small details to attract consumers, or using death date to remind consumers you may have to buy a new one by the end of this date. However, the more you need, the more you will waste. You do not actually need two deodorants for both you and your partner. One is enough, so the other one you bought together will either be waste or be used after a long time. For the majority of people, the additional deodorant will end up as a waste. Similar situation happens at every industry. Merchants always have the way to promote consumption. What we can do is try to figure out what we really need before each shopping trip.

<Br><hr>
Thanks for your appreciation. Also, do you notice that Packard claimed that if aggregate consumption in any given year is not 4% higher than last year, the country may then face recession? In this way, people have to continue consuming and creating higher GDP in order to prevent economic depression. However, the need for human is fixed, thus consuming more means buying things that they don't actually need.

Society is very easily influenced. Everyone wants to show off the newest and hottest brands so others don’t think less of them. It’s a sickness, really. It’s hard to change this mindset if it’s instilled as a child though; as some kids are bullied for not having “new” and fresh clothes and items at school. But growing into adults, people should be educated about how we’re basically puppets to the world of consumerism. 
 <br><br>
We always need the newest phones, just to have them easily break and/or start acting up within the first year. After the first year, we want to get the next new model. We’re constantly in this cycle of buying and throwing away and all this money is going to companies and industries that are making sure we keep going back to them. Not only do these industries suck the money out of us, but they have horrible working environments and do so much worse to our earth’s environment. It really puts things into a different perspective after reading about our culture and consumerism in “The Waste Makers”.

The “Wastemakers” mainly talks about fueling consumerism in order to achieve happiness/contentment. I’m currently in social psychology, and we’re learning about how people think purchasing material goods will bring happiness. However, it never lasts; it’s just fleeting. We’ll always crave more, and we continue to want the next best thing. Most everyday items we use such as our phones, computers, and other appliances are at their peak function, but companies find a different way to market it to consumers every year. They add one or two more functions the following year, and increase the prices to customers. This form of marketing allows consumers to feel like they’re buying something new and innovative. However, what they already have is sufficient for everyday use. Unfortunately, society places a lot of emphasis on having the newest item, but it creates a lot of waste and is bad for the environment. Ken specifically lists this issue as one of the five ways to alleviate/mitigate the climate crisis. We must use less, so we can waste less.

It is crazy that having the new item is just apart of society, but how detrimental it is to our environment. For a while I always wanted name brand clothes and the newest IPhone. After realizing that shopping was a temporary happiness I started investing is things that would keep me happy and that happened once I got to UCSB. This class really puts me in a reality check because I did not think anything bad of consumerism other than how much money I lose out on. Now I understand how it affects our climate and even ones mental health and how reducing my shopping habits can either help or tear down crooked companies.

I definitely agree with all of the points you made above. I also think psychology is a great way to understand why we consume and waste so many material goods as humans. The problem is there will always be a void in your heart because you will never be satisfied with how many items you end up getting. As for wasting, I believe that people do it because it doesn't affect their daily lives. For instance, dumping a plastic cup in the ocean, no matter how immoral, realistically won't affect the person's life who's throwing it. Since being wasteful doesn't have a direct consequence on people's lives who end up wasting a lot of goods, they don't mind doing it over and over again which is why we must step in and change that mindset. There are plenty of people in the world who desperately need food as we all know. To me, I find it unfortunate that restaurants and supermarkets usually throw away all their uneaten food. I think developing food banks where stores can actively donate unbought food supplies to aid the homeless is a great way to make use of leftover food. Instead of being fueled by consumerism like the "Wastemakers" point out about our society, we can instead help other people by giving supplies to those in desperate need. This will result in less waste on the planet and will keep more people fed worldwide.

I had a very similar reaction to reading "The Waste Makers". It's quite interesting to understand the history of consumerism and how it developed to be such key aspect of American life.  Generations of people have grown up with this mindset that consumption in some way equates to happiness, and they continue to pass this down to future generations. Its truly critical that we disrupt this cycle if we have any hope of saving our planet

 <br><br>

I've been aware of assumed obsolescence and designed obsolescence for a while now, but I still often find myself falling victim to these business practices. I find this influence strongest around products in the tech world. These huge companies are constantly pumping out new products and features, and we as consumers can't help but line up in front of their stores for each new release. While, I feel like public awareness of this issue is growing, I'm very doubtful that this pattern will change anytime soon.



<br><hr>
I agree with Luong on this, since I studied SOC 1 last quarter, it kind of confuses me too about how consuming satisfies short-time happiness. In this video, the professor mainly talks about how the suppliers tend to do for profiting through many examples, such as smoking and fossil fuels. All in conclusion is that people are just too greedy to want everything, and these kind of low-level desire tends to waste the basic living conditions for humans. 
 <br><br>
Also when the professor talks about the root of why Americans tend to waste resources, he mainly talks about historical reasons and how capitalism tends to work towards.




<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your idea that some company just adding one or two new functions of their product to make us think that we are buying a new product. Just like whenever a new iPhone appears, they change some settings to reduce the reliability of consumers' battery use and make people think they need to buy a new iPhone. It's a coincidence that when your new phone came out, did your phone feel less powerful? These companies designed it psychologically. The sad truth is that Americans are spending money and buying things they don't need now. They are using future money through credit cards. This is extremely detrimental to the environment and the economy.

I talked a little bit about happiness in relation to material goods last week, when we watched the film Minimalism. I talked mostly about my relation to some material goods, but not so much about purchasing more. The other day, I was thinking about iPhones versus other brands of smartphones. iPhones are ridiculously expensive, and I only have one because it was a gift from my grandparents. But ever since I have had a smartphone, I have owned iPhones. I have always thought to myself-- I can never switch over to another brand, because I like the way Apple devices function and pair with other devices so well. But recently, I have been wondering: how much of that thought process is fueled by our consumerist society? Most people cannot afford the cost of an iPhone upfront (instead they use payment plans), but they keep purchasing them because our society tells us they are a marker of "coolness" and even wealth. iPhones stop working after about two years, because Apple will put out new software updates that need a new phone to function on. Because of this, everyone with an iPhone must purchase a new one every two years. It is a vicious cycle. My next phone will probably be something made by a company other than Apple...

I agree with your point that material goods do not bring happiness. I have experienced this firsthand. In a society driven largely by monetary goals, companies trying to market slightly changed, new products every year to drive consumerism is inevitable. Unfortunately, this consumer culture does cause a lot of waste that is very negative for the environment. Reading “The Waste Makers” was pretty eye opening to me because it feels like big corporations have been brainwashing people into believing that it is our job to consume. This belief that we must have the newest items and constantly consume is just a great marketing tool used by corporations. We should not fall for this marketing tactic and choose to consume only the things that we really need in order to cut down on our waste.



<br><hr>
I also agree with all the points that you made. Consumerism is never equal to happiness/contentment because the best things in our life shouldn't be things anyway. There is never an end of purchasing, because there's always better material goods and no one on Earth could afford them all. In the current society, companies are making advertisements that make their products seem much different from their versions before, simply to make it more desirable and push people to buy them. However, people sometimes choose to intentionally neglect the fact that the ones in our hand, phone, laptop, clothes etc. They're still working just fine. As Ken suggested, buying less could be an important way of limiting our waste. It's not as hard as changing my diet in my opinion. So, simply buying less is what we can do to save our environment.




<br><hr>
I felt the same way while reading this. It's crazy to think that the emphasis on consumerism dates back to nearly a century ago; nonetheless, the conditions back then called for dire solutions and that seemed to be the most reasonable. It's still crazy to think that this business practice was being utilized so long ago but isn't nearly as abused as it is today. Technology wasn't as advanced in the 1900s, so it was easy to improve upon the functionality of certain products and thus the prior model would become obsolete. Today's society abuses this practice so much. Like you said, society today places so much emphasis on having the newest edition or the newest model of a line of products, regardless of what it is. What I've noticed is that a lot of this stems from the world of technology and also cars. With iPhones and Macs, everybody wants the newest model, even if that means having to buy several dongles just to actually use your devices. With cars, I don't really see how a 2020 model is really that much different from the 2019 model but when given the choice it seems that people will always go for the more expensive and newer kind. It's basically the same thing, and in this process, you're emitting so much into the atmosphere because of the consumerist habits.
 <br><br>

Like you said, we're essentially stuck in this cycle of consume, waste, throw away, repeat. Our happiness will never be satisfied even when we have the newest thing because there will always be something newer that comes out after it. It's a fleeting happiness, but it's something that we chase even though we know we'll never catch it.


<br><hr>


It's sad to think that our happiness that comes from “never lasts” but that's the reality. The reading “The Wastemakers” by Vance Packard shines a light on the distasteful attitudes consumers have when it comes to products. We buy, we use for a little, we throw away, we get a new thing. This vicious cycle has changed over the years as Packard shows. We are using less now and just buying for mere feeling of buying. I would hope that I buy products such as clothing because I need it not because I just want the feeling of having something new but I’m not quite sure that's the case. That is what happens to most people and who is to say I am any different. I will try to make a change based on what I learned from “The Wastemakers.”

Consumerism really is one of the worst parts of our society today. This reading, along with Ken’s video, were really interesting to me as it brought up concepts of consumerism that I wasn’t aware of before. Something I never realized was how much industries and companies are to blame for the highly materialistic world we live in today. I definitely think there are many to blame for this, especially the media as it’s one of the most common forms people use to share their most prized possessions, encouraging others to want the same materialistic lifestyle as theirs. However, I’ve now realized how much influence manufacturers have on the things people are encouraged to buy, mainly for reasons that benefit them more than the consumer. One of the examples brought up in the reading was when, “Hosiery manufacturers began trying to sell more pairs of stockings to each American woman by introducing colored stockings. Women were told that their stockings should match whatever costume or accessories they would be wearing.” Examples such as this one really go to show just how influenced we are into the consumer culture we live in today. Yet so many don’t even realize it. So to answer Ken’s question, I think many people are to blame for consumerism. Not only the manufacturers who influence us into it. But us consumers, as well, who have allowed consumerism to get to the alarming level it is at now. Given that I wasn’t aware of half this information prior to reading some chapters of this book, I feel it’s really important they become aware, in order for change to be made.

This week’s reading of “The Waste Makers” further engrained into me what last week’s reading of “Walden” did: consumerism culture has made us, specifically Americans, increasingly unhappy. We have been taught to constantly buy and look for upgrades. We are never satisfied with what we have, always looking to buy more. We will never be content if we maintain the consumerist culture we have been taught since we were young. To move towards minimalism is to find happiness. I believe the manufacturers and advertisement companies are largely to blame for the obsession with material objects; however, we, the buyers, cannot ignore our role in it as well.

I completely agree. To me, this reading showed how producers and government have manipulated consumers into buying more, essentially brainwashing the public, for their own benefit. The tactics of changing the aesthetic of a good or calculating it’s life time in order to guarantee more purchases were sickening. In this way, we really are becoming more “unhappy” as Walden said. However, I believe that this deep seeded unhappiness rooted in unfulfillment is hidden by a false happiness. I agree that we’re always looking for more, which shows our surface level happiness or at least complacency, but never find what we’re looking for. In order to change this cycle, we need to reevaluate our mindset towards consuming and prioritizing only purchasing what we really need. I agree that the temptations made by advertising are overwhelming, but when we frame minimalism as a tactic for improving our own wellbeing, I think it can be possible to change our consumerist culture.


<br><hr>

I was thinking of Walden while i read "The Waste Makers" as well. Consumerism culture is not always going to make people happy. Yea i have a bunch of things but I am never satisfied. Once the new edition, model, etc. of something comes out then i want that and just want to get rid of what once was what i desired. this chain just goes on and will contribute to someone's carbon footprint heavily. I also believe that the company heads and the rich people at the top of industries and models are to blame for the desire of these new objects.



<br><hr>

Reading "The Waste Makers"  brought me to the same conclusion about the relationship between materialistic pursuits and the happiness of people. Constantly looking for more, to buy more, to consume more is fruitless. We have seen that as a civilization we have done a massive amount of damage to our very home. Growing up you have no choice but to learn what you are taught and that is a cycle that is very deeply engrained in everyone. To grow up both physically and mentally allows us to see things at a larger scale and understand that there a changes that can be made as an individual and as a society.



<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. Even while reading the first chapter of the Waste Maker chapters assigned to us, I was appalled by the mindset it talked about. Companies are increasing the speed at which they can manufacture products, so their goal becomes convincing people to buy products that they don’t really need or want, just in order to make a profit. This really bothers me. Our lives are already so oversaturated with “stuff,” most of which we don’t need, yet we’re constantly being bombarded with advertisements trying to get us to just buy more, and more, and more. Marketing teams try to devise ways to convince us that we need their products, or that their products will make us happier, but this probably couldn’t be further from the truth.

 <br><br>

Though most people aren’t willing to go to the extent of Thoreau, who didn’t want to keep even two pieces of limestone on his desk for decoration, we need to have a cultural shift toward owning less. Minimalism doesn’t need to mean that you can only own the bare minimum; even just minimizing, or reducing, our possessions can help. Marie Kondo champions this perspective: she urges people to keep only 1) things that are useful and 2) things that spark joy. If I applied these two simple requirements to the stuff that I own, a good portion of it probably wouldn’t pass. We think that if we accumulate more things, they will make us happy, when in reality many of the things we already own don’t even make us happy. If we stop looking for things we don’t have, and instead focus on the things we do have that bring us joy, while getting rid of those that don’t, we may finally start to truly be satisfied.

I really liked your concise reflection on this week’s reading. I also see the connection with last week’s reading of “Walden” and its parallels with “The Waste Makers”. Both readings offer an insight into society and how it has turned into a fast-paced, consumer culture. What I especially found interesting about “The Waste Makers” was how the author was able to live through the transition into consumerism and the rise of the biggest industries that we know today. Many of the principles of how to market products to the public have evolved into an elaborate network of advertisements, mass consumption, and the constant production of things. Both “Walden” and “The Waste Makers” alert the readers about the dangers and consequences of being a materialistic society.

 <br><br>

But your last comment is definitely something I want to explore more about. After all, who is to blame for all of this? Is it the companies that prey on the consumers and grooms us to purchase their products? Or should we be looking more at the consumers who are the ones actually buying and supporting these companies? Although I do believe that we are both to blame, both seem to be dependent on the other. However, I believe that companies will never stop trying to make a profit and sell their products for mass consumption, so it is up to the consumers to change the way in which they consume if we are to see any change in the industry. Because these companies are protected by their right to free enterprise, we should not be waiting for them to stop profiting off of us at the expense of others and the planet.

Planned obsolescence - of quality and desirability - is a pretty terrible practice. Fueled by greed, this exploitation drains money from consumers, burns through resources, and produces tons of waste. The only form of obsolescence that is decent is that of functionality, given that the new product is significantly superior to its predecessor. Otherwise, t's just another money-making scheme. After reading about the history of planned obsolescence in chapters six and seven of "The Waste Makers", I was annoyed. The amount of thought and justifications that went into designing it is astonishing. I feel bad for the engineers that work on the design of the products that are part of planned obsolescence. They spend all of that time and money in school figuring out the best way to make something that works and works for a long time just to get a job and be told: "Forget all of that. You're here to make crap." Not only is it a punch to the gut for the schooling, but to their pride as well. Imagine putting "I built something that lasts for a year when it could have done 10" on a resume. Also, the idea of obsolescence due to desirability pisses me off. Why would I want to buy the same exact product I ALREADY OWN just because it is orange instead of green or has a fancier design? Mine still works. In my opinion, we should let the engineers do their proper jobs and make things that last. I'd rather pay a little more for something that will last five times longer. And if consumers feel so strongly about accessories, engineers can design a customizable product with a slightly higher cost than a whole new item. An alternative is to commission an artist to customize your product to your liking. This would save money and resources and decrease our waste.
 <br><br>

Speaking of waste, I cannot believe that people thought "Oh throwing away everything we use won't come back to bite us." Where did they think the stuff was going? None of the disposable items (single-use cooking containers, boil-able plastic bags, disposable utensils) can be reused. Another example of burning resources and creating tons of waste. Many of the disposable products weren't even used to their full capacity. Packard cites lipstick tubes that can't push the whole stick out, paste jars with brushes that can't even reach the bottom of the container, a whipped cream dispenser that runs of out pressure to remove all of the cream. If an observer that did not understand the marketing ploys being deployed here, they would assume Americans are useless at making things.

 <br><br>

We as a society really need to push for sustainable, long-lasting products, if products at all. This disposable item phenomenon is wasteful and killing the earth.

I didn’t even know consumerism is a real word until I take climate crisis 101. I used to think there is nothing wrong with shopping. If you can have more, just get more. My professor from the economic department always tells me that consumption needs to increase to keep up with the pace of production. However,  on the other hand, shouldn’t the production also slows down to meet consumption. While reading this book  I cannot stop feeling sad about how naive these producing companies are. They begged consumers to buy more products before and after the Great Recession. They think that the fail of consumption has led to the recession. From my perspective, the recession happened because there is too much unnecessary stuff being made. It takes time to earn enough profit to advance a business, but those industries just can’t wait for a second to become a billion-dollar company. Also, thrown-away culture is terrible. Right now the newest iPhone 11 has two to three cameras. Maybe the iPhone 12 will get a removable camera. But people are taking action. England is going to ban plastic items starting in April 2020. I don’t know other countries but it is cool to have a plastic-free nation.

I agree with you so many unnecessary things are being purchased, and invented every single day. I like how you mentioned your economics class. Speaking of the iPhones, I know that once the new one comes out, a good number of people who can afford it will purchase it. The cost is what's holding a lot of other people back because who wouldn't want an upgrade? It's such a common craving, something new or something better. I thought it was interesting to read "And the television set may be substituting for adequate food in the family budget.". It's crazy to think how much money is spent on things that don't even last a year. We're so quick to get tired of something when it's still functional. Consumption can only continue for so long. Once we become poor poor, then there will be a significant drop in sales or an increase in debt.

This reading was crazy because all the things Packard wrote about are still relevant today, 60 years later! I’ve always known we’ve lived in a consumerist society, but reading about the marketing techniques and behind the scenes secrets of companies and product production was gross, it was just gross. The fact that ⅖ of the things a person owned was not essential to their physical well-being, and that the government, the people Americans are supposed to trust to the most told consumers to buy more or there will be less work is astonishing. I hated how the government had to instill fear into everyday people to buy things or else, just to get Americans to consume even more unnecessary stuff.
 <br><br>

I also found it funny (in a sad way) that America has always spent excess money on defense, which Trump has certainly been blowing out of proportion (of course insteading of investing millions of dollars in healthcare or education, he sees building a flimsy wall as most important). I enjoyed the way that Packard described the “voracious appetite” of mass production, because consumerism is never full, it is never satisfied and it constantly hunts for more. Just as chapter 4 is titled, “there is always room for more.”
 <br><br>

It’s crazy to see how companies get people to buy more through advertising and manipulation like people needing “nailpolish for every mood” or people with glasses needing “more than one pair of glasses for safety and style” and how all companies promoted two of everything, and created products to seem bigger and better. It’s even more disappointing that companies manufactured products using death-dating; where they deliberately created low quality products and still stuck on a high sticker price. This led to a waste of materials, time, and money which all contributed to an overflow of unnecessary products, adding to the growing climate crisis. I’ve said this about almost every reading, film, and lecture videos but once again, everything is about money.

I too found this reading to be applicable to the present. You could simply replace some of the outdated products mentioned, for example the two track stereo, with say... the newest. bluetooth speaker and it could pass for a piece published last week. It was fascinating reading how these companies and the "admen" have tricked us into absolutely needing their newest and most expensive products. I think it's also somewhat sad that our economy relies so much on military spending. Even decades ago, Packard described how politicians could never get behind a cut in the defense budget because that would lead to their constituents losing jobs. Which brings me to how uneasy it makes me when hearing about the government's role in some of the consumerism. Of course they set the extravagant defense budget, but they also pushed the consumerism culture. I understand it might've been necessary to get the US out of a recession, but it has carried on and is still felt. 
 <br><br>

On another note, I couldn't help but notice just how heinous some of these targeted advertisements were. The one that was most striking to me was B. Earl Puckett, while at a fashion conference declaring that "it is [their] job to make women unhappy with what they have." Packard went on to explain how this strategy was beginning to be applied to many other industries, and with great effectiveness. 
 <br><br>

I found the whole "permanent" anti-freeze situation both funny and disheartening. Funny that their advertisement strategy completely backfired and left many unhappy. However, it was disheartening that even after this, the so called admen are still able to have such control. It's frustrating how manipulative they can be, sometimes without notice.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with you Liliana. I found it super impressive how this article still holds so much truth today. After reading Packard's article "Wastemakers", I feel deeply considered about the malicious intents of many large corporations. This article breaks down all the methods in which companies feed consumerism and build this off of a culture of waste. One statistic that really concerned me was that "2/5 of the goods owned by the average citizen were not essential to their physical well-being". Especially after watching the "Minimalism" video last week, this statistic is far too much. I even bet that this has grown since this article was written. I think that by using goods only essential to life and well being, people can make a difference in the climate of the planet but also be happier beings in general.
 <br><br>

The chapters based on "always having room for more", and "growthmanship" really explain how companies want to make products seem dated so people will replace them. Another tactic is for companies to convince people that more is better. I am a huge fan of Marie Kondo who makes a full living off of having the least items necessary and living a minimalist life. These tactics are completely opposite to what consumerist culture represents. Kondo always talks about only keeping items that "spark joy". I think this is an incredible way to live life because it keeps people from buying useful products that were wasteful to manufacture and don't bring any sort of use into life. 
 <br><br>

Overall, after watching Ken's take on the reading, I was most shocked by the comparison to the tobacco industry. This industry is malicious and doesn't even care that they are marketing to kids. Applied to the whole climate crisis, this exemplifies that companies care more about the good of their own industries over the well being of customers. I really hope there is a way to inspire more people to recycle, reuse items, and mostly not buy products that they do not need.



<br><hr>
That specific statistic of the 2/5 things also stood out to me, and it got me thinking about my own life and all the unnecessary things I own. I think if everyone did some self reflecting on what they buy versus what they actually use and need, they would be happier and the planet could be helped. 
 <br><br>

I have not watched Marie Kondo but I am very aware of her "spark joy" motto. Although I do not follow her, I do think her motto is a good way for anyone to declutter their life. 
 <br><br>

The comparisons to the tobacco industry is very fitting, because like the fast fashion industries, they know all the harm they are causing and yet they continue to do it. We do need to recycle and reuse items, and thrifting is a great way of doing so.

</span></div><hr>


<p>
In “The Waste Makers” by Vance Packard, there is a clear illustration about how companies and industries have made effort to maintain the materialist cultures and behaviors among consumers and public in the pursuit of their own effort. Ken has talked about the tobacco industry before which is an exemplary justification of the fact. 
 <br><br>

 We sometimes buy the products which are much more than we need due to the new packaging, more comprehensive functions, and more advanced technology without thinking about how the extra consumption would negatively contribute to the environment.

This is the second time I got scared after going through our course material, then I realized this article was in 1960s, 60 years ago. Luckily the facts in this article are not happening in today. This article gives tons of examples about how different companies and industries posted advertisements to persuade consumers to buy their products, no matter their products are useful or not and environmental friendly or not. Then, in the following chapter, the author continued writing about consumers should throw away their used products, whether it is environmental friendly or not. He provided tons of examples of companies and industries that deal with throwaways. American people were held hostages. Their daily life were monitored totally. It’s sad.

While reading Waste Makers, I also couldn't help but notice it was written so long ago. That said, it didn't really change my opinions on the piece because I feel that it is very much still true of today, if not worse today. Families are still looked down upon for having less than multiple cars, it's still commonplace to buy new models before things actually wear out, and we still discard clothes for new ones on the daily. Yes, this may be partially built into our culture dating back to the 60s, but whether we realize it or not, it also comes from current corporal manipulation. Subliminal messages are still very relevant in advertising today, and part of making the change to minimalism is waking up to realize that our "need" for excess goods is not real, it's all a clever ruse. 
 <br><br>

About the actual reading, I really enjoying learning where America's current state of excess originated from. To learn it was deliberate was quite painful, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. All of the issues we've discussed in this class were anthropogenic- brought on by ourselves- so why should the roots of those problems not be us as well. sigh When are we going to start seeing an upside Ken !!!

<br><hr>
Don’t blame Ken and his generation. Rather, think about what we the new generation can do to not make the same mistake that the old generation made. Think about what the new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis. Think about what the new generation can do to convince the old generation to become environmental friendly. Heavy hangs the head.

This book illuminates just how enslaved the American people are to consumerism. Since the end of World War 2,  big businesses have controlled the minds of American consumers and turned them into sheep desperate to show their social status through material possessions. While the excessive production was a feasible solution during times of hardship in the United States, this plan should have been discontinued once things had settled. For the past 75 years the consumerism has intensified with every passing year to the extent that people will buy things they know they do not need just to assert their social status. It is bothersome to me that the large companies in America have so much control over the decisions of average Americans. The line from the book, "You peasants who own only one car are chained to the land like serfs in the Middle Ages" when describing the expectation to have two cars really disgusted me. Big companies used, and continue to use, manipulative marketing strategies to make consumers feel behind if they are not buying the most recent technology or having as much of whats popular as their neighbors. 
 <br><br>
A relevant example of this phenomenon from today's world is the habit of people to buy the new iPhone every year, despite their current one being completely functional. I've fallen victim to this myself and felt compelled to buy the newest phone even though part of me knows that the upgrades are minimal and the price is expensive. This contributes to a culture of waste wherein people use a good not until its finished, but until a better good comes out and replaces it. This destroys the craftsmanship that once drove people's decision to consume. 
 <br><br>
This is also seen in the clothing industry where fast fashion has taken over. People used to buy clothes with the intention of keeping them until they are not usable. Nowadays, people buy clothes to keep up with ephemeral trends that are deemed out of style just months later. This strange pattern induces incredible volume of waste. People are buying far more clothes than they need to keep up with trends contrived by the clothing industry. Manipulative advertising bends the minds of the consumer into thinking that they must keep up with "what is cool" or they will drop down the ranks of social hierarchy. This toxic relationship between the consumer and the clothing industry has not only largely destroyed individualistic personal society but also exacerbates social issues of depression and anxiety. I feel as if celebrities are heavily responsible for the enabling of this perverse culture because they are the ones powering most of the manipulative advertising. To me, it seems a bit late to try to change consumerist culture in the United States. As sad as it sounds, a part of me believes that we as consumers are too far gone.

this reading of the waste makers is all about capitalism. The consumption of goods is  a big thing with us Americans we buy and buy and don’t think about what we are doing.  Many dont realize how much we are consuming and how it is affecting the earth because I already know that all us are just going to throw it all away in the long run just because it gets “old” or just doesnt fit the style you are trying to reach anymore. Many of these companies are just trying to get people to buy and they are just trying to sell. Money plays a big role due to the fact that, who doesnt like money? Also big corporations advertise clothing to make it seem like the next big thing and that its a necessity to make that purchase. It is kind of sad to think that is our mentality now, its all about the money. But they are not thinking about the true cost that is hurting the Earth.

As consumerism is so popular today, people adjust to it and even praise this culture highly. People seek objects that are “fashionable”, “advanced”, and “expensive”. For me, I am kind of one member of this group. As the new version of iPhone releases, I would probably buy the new one. This makes me feel regret and shame. It is a really bad and misleading culture and I would say that industries and corporations also promote this kind of culture to lead people to purchase and make profits. However, in my opinion, I believe that reengineering consumerism and people’s beliefs are quite difficult, and this issue is so sophisticated that someone may argue that it is about freedom and human rights. As the world is developing and individuals’ living conditions are getting better, the situation of consumerism may be worse and worse unless people could realize the detrimental effects of this consumerism and culture brought to the environment and our planet. By the way, I still feel optimistic toward this problem and I hope individuals, as well as myself, could discard this environmental-unfriendly culture and belief.

“Americans had been the most desiring people in the world.” This statement is truly not surprising, taking into consideration how the majority of the population looks up to individuals of high social and economic status, and deem them as important figures. What really got me were the slogans during Eisenhower’s time, which had phrases like, “Buy and be happy” and “Buy, buy, buy; it’s your patriotic duty.” 
 <br><br>

Reading about the production and “improvement” of products in the 1960s really forced me to relate that to today’s production of goods, and how much money and research is being put into the unnecessary alteration of items. Manufacturers and researchers find ways to tweak this and that in popular consumer products such as microwaves and cars, which persuade the consumer to want to purchase this “new and improved” item. THIS IS EVIL. Consumers are spending their well-earned money on products that have been tweaked in the slightest ways. Even if it was changed in a massive way, how much of that change was truly needed? Reading how the U.S. government puts BILLIONS of dollars into the country’s crops, which are later put into bins made of scarce metal, which then leads to a surplus of grain, really does not settle well within me. There is so much wrong with every part of that sentence, yet this is the reality of America’s economy and future. We are basically relating consumption to the positive growth of our economy. Speaking of things going wrong, there has been an issue with roads and highways not having enough space, and constantly having to widen and expand. There is not enough space, yet America thinks it’s a good idea to promote a multiple-car lifestyle?? Please make that make sense... 
 <br><br>

If good are are not being sold and produced at the rate in which manufacturers want, why make such an abundance in the first place? What is hurting us are politicians. They control output and output, using that influence to call for more “growth” every year. What also struck me was the comparison between America and Russia’s economics. America outproduced Russia in consumer durables in a 20:1 ratio, while Russia also spent less money than us while sending a satellite around the moon. It was well stated in the book that “Russia simply has a different set of national priorities.”  This horrible outlook on the U.S. economy is much like the discouraging fact that the U.S. is only 4% of the world’s population, yet contributes to a quarter of the world’s atmospheric CO2. 
 <br><br>

Lastly, I realized consumption is a mental thing. Humans must be mentally aware of what they need and do not need, and the difference between a need and a want. Companies pull consumers in by stating what we must buy, why we must buy, and that we need to buy it as soon as we can. Once more and more people join that bandwagon of purchasing, many will follow… even if they were not interested in the product in the first place. It is all a sort of psychological game.

You made so many good points. It's crazy how this brainwashing has developed over the past years. People are constantly being fed these lies that we need new things all the time when in reality there's absolutely nothing wrong with what we have. Or the companies even go so far as to reduce the quality of their product so we are forced to buy a replacement. For example, Apple releases a new iPhone every year but what really gets me is the fact that they make it so our phones can only last for about 3 years. We literally have no choice but to upgrade at that point. It sucks because we have the technology to actually produce good and long-lasting products but the corporations know that by doing that, there would be a decrease in the need to buy more of it. There used to be an emphasis on quality which can be seen in the fact that a lot of places used marble or other expensive materials to ensure that it would last a lifetime. If we actually took a moment to make a list of what we need and don't need, we would realize how much of the stuff we own is useless. We can see this in how we interact with these products. Let's say we buy a new top from Forever 21, we wear it maybe 3 times and then realize we actually don't like the top and shove it to the far back of the drawer to replace with new clothes, and the cycle continues.
 <br><br>
What is truly heartbreaking is how incredibly flawed the US is, yet we are meant to be the role model for developing countries. They see our wealth and try to follow in our examples not realizing that our path leads to inevitable destruction. So many of our problems are actually culture ones that have been shoved down our throats. We are taught to be selfish, materialistic, and shallow. All that matters is what we have and we are willing to throw everything away, like our relationships, in order to chase after the "American Dream."


<br><hr>
The entire time I was reading your comment I was nodding my head in agreement along with everything you said. You stated so many true facts, which unfortunately all were sad. Like you said it really is evil how companies will tweak an item to make it “new and improved” where in reality they really didn’t need to “improve” it. I always thought that the meaning behind improving something was because that thing had a glitch or there was something wrong with it (i.e. it was broken or malfunctioning). The further and further we get into this quarter in this class, the sadder and sadder I get because of how much I am reminded of how Americans have contributed so much to the CO2 pollution in the atmosphere. I still freak out every time I hear that the US has put a fourth of the CO2 production into the atmosphere. Another fact I think is so messed up is how expensive manufacturers make cars, microwaves or other appliances. Some of which are necessities, and yet they still cost an arm and a leg to own. Just being here in college and having to buy a mini fridge, a MINI fridge, it cost more than half of my paycheck. Yes, it is a minimum wage job, but a lot of Americans only work one-two minimum wage jobs for a living. Because we live in an environment where we are taught to buy, buy, buy we find that people have to work more and more in order to pay the bills and to keep up with their shopping habits.

You make really good points here that I couldn't agree with you anymore on, especially right on the spot with the Eisenhower Era slogans which were formed in a Era of economic boom from the result of the second world war. Consumption must rise, and keep rising. The quote "some marketing
  <br><br>
experts have been announcing that the average citizen will have to step up his buying by nearly 50 per cent in the next dozen years, or the economy will sicken", has been the underlying teaching of our society with advertisements that flood the streets, buildings and in our very lives from our homes to our phones. What you touched on about human consumption being a mental aspect of our lives explains for the reason why we are exposed to such barrages of advertisements that trick our psyche into this belief that buying will benefit us and benefit our economy.  One way to describe this technique that's pushed out by industries within the United States that allow them to trick the people in this buy all state of mind as Vance Packard states like, “You sell replacements; you sell more than one item to each family; or you dream up a new or improved product-or one that at least seems new or improved-that will enchant families that already own an "old" model of your product. (A fourth possibility is to move into a different line.)”. One example of this in the very work is the through Apple’s Iphone production which releases a “new” and “improved” version of their phones that gets millions into this stir of buying it because it’s new. 
 <br><br>

An example comes down for myself when I played baseball in High School. Every other season in baseball, we would buy new bats for the team and typically Easton because of the fact that our coach had a friend who was a rep from Easton and could get us them for cheaper, especially the “newest” models which were apparently better than the year after with a new paint style and grip, etc. But it was supposed to be better than the years before and thus we believe, but as wear and tear took place and revealed the true paint. The paint under the outer coat was the same paint style as the year before which in reality wasn’t even new. This has always reminisce me to believe that “is newer really better, as they say”? 
 <br><br>

What also really stuck out me was the “Say’s Law” which stated that supply creates its own deeper demand which would undoubtedly lead to the rise of what we call consumerism. Through the Journal of Retailing states that we should make our lives and culture based around consumerism to keep Say’s Law alive and keep the economy growing. Why should a culture surround itself by rampant consumerism to feed the big industries? Shouldn’t the culture be about the people, traditions and many other things that are shared with one another, friend to family, and family to community? I have always questioned these such things ever since Ken introduced me to the film, “The True Cost” in english 22, where I watched how the fast fashion culture influenced the minds of the many in the Western half of the world to grow into this buy, buy, buy, mentality without understanding the wider consequences that result from the rise of consumerism where more and more lives are put at risk through pollution, bad work environments, and  deeper consequences on the lives entangled in supplying the ever growing consumerist society that lays upon the western hemisphere of the world.

This document was written sixty years ago and discusses how America would have to increase our consumption by fifty percent in the next fifty years in order to keep up our economy and that has shown true in the advertisements of consumerism in recent years. This was a very unfortunate idea for the western world to have because now we have a terribly addicted consumer culture in the United States. We, as citizens of America, define ourselves by the amount and price of the products we own from technology, clothing, accessories, vehicles, and appliances. Not only is this degrading to humans self worth and happiness it is degrading the earth through the mass production of useless items that are only producing more greenhouse gases and using up nonrenewable sources like water. And for what? It is very disturbing to hear Americans and the government saying that they do not believe a country as large as us could ever transition to renewable energy or attempt to emit less carbon by reducing production. “The United States is already outproducing Russia in consumer durables by at least twenty to one,” when their country is far larger, in terms of area, than the US. These other countries around the world have already proven this statement that transitioning to renewable energy is impossible to do and remain in a stable economy wrong by making the transition themselves.

“Waste Makers” by Vance Packard did not necessarily shock me in that America is a “throw away” society, I unfortunately was already aware of that glaringly true fact. What did shock and upset me, however, was just how much we are this society because of large corporations. The chapters were example after example of how the American public has been manipulated into thinking that they need new models of everything and everything in life has to be convenient for it to be luxurious. I felt sick reading the mentality of advertisers who knew exactly what they were doing in creating this wasteful society and did so anyway for their own monetary gain. However, out of this feeling of pure disgust, I also found myself thinking, “I cant believe consumers didn't realize what was being done to them”. And then it hit me- hard. I'm just as brainwashed. If I don't have the newest IPhone, car, or clothes, I automatically feel inferior. I have bought pre-sliced and plastic wrapped fruit. Reading these chapters, I was so unbelievably upset with myself for letting myself become brainwashed that the reading had an unexpected effect. A new mindset. Now, whenever someone smirks at my car or my shoes, instead of feeling ashamed or embarrassed, I will feel superior, know that they are the ones that are brainwashed and I am free from corporate manipulation. Whenever I watch a commercial for a newer and better product, I will change the channel. I will value my items more, treat them better, and make them last. This reading was exactly the slap in the face I needed and I am so glad to have read it.

I agree that this "throw away" attitude is prevalent with almost everything. I have been through 3 iPhones in my life, and every time I got a new one it was because my old one simply stopped working. At first I attributed this to the technology just being overused, or running it's natural life cycle, but it wasn't until my iPhone 6 (which is considered outdated in today's terms) started crashing and losing 100% in 5 minutes that I realized these devices are engineered to die. The whole purpose is to force us to buy the next phone instead of going through the trouble to get it fixed. Apple continuously outputs software updates that require a certain amount of storage that older models of iPhones simply do not have, and if you get far enough behind on software updates, your apps no longer work as they require a certain IOS version or better. This happened to my mom, who has a iPhone 5. She tried to pay for her coffee with the Starbucks app, but was instead presented with the message that the app no longer worked with her version of IOS. However, it is impossible for her to update her IOS with the model and storage of her phone. In the grand scheme of things, phones are extremely trivial and not so important but this example just shows how these companies want us to buy more and more and more. There are crazy conspiracies that the cure for cancer has been found but withheld from the public because chemotherapy is a treatment patients must repeatedly return for and pay for over and over again. A cure would not generate the same amount of money. While this definitely sounds farfetched, it is based on this same mentality that profit and returning customers are far more important to corporations than the well being and lasting satisfaction of their consumers. I do try my hardest to do my part in reusing and wearing out my possessions until I cannot anymore, and try to avoid buying something for the sole purpose of it being "new", but I can do better. We can all do better. The public IS the one force large enough to combat the power of big companies and their money, as we are the ones giving them their power in the first place, but we must ALL be on board.

Along with you, I can’t say I was shocked after reading the first few chapters of The Waste Makers. I think subconsciously I always knew there was something wrong with the way we consume, but I never really put much more thought into it rather than just oh, this is probably not great for the environment. What did alarm me was how much I not only do the things that were mentioned in my own life, but I also see almost everyone around me doing them too. The amount of people who just buy and throw away and buy and throw away is scary. Where does the old stuff go if things are literally constantly being produced day in and day out. The reading was also interesting to me because smart engineers are using their knowledge and education to make a product worse… didn't they go to school to do the opposite? I, along with you, also feel brainwashed by the consumer market that our economy has created today. I had the iphone 10 and got the 11 because it had a better camera? I didn't need a better camera. I am addicted to the idea of having the best things and I don't even know when or how that idea got implanted into my brain. It’s scary. And it's even more scary that the generations to come will be even more obsessed with the new best thing or having as many cars, clothes, accessories as possible. I am changing the way I live my life to be happy with the things I have and to buy responsibly and eco friendly. I am scared for where we are heading and would like to do everything in my power to help contribute to a fix.

I had a similar reaction to reading the article that you did. I was already aware that in America people tend to quickly throw away old objects rather than reusing them because of their desire for something newer, bigger, or "better." However, "Waste Makers" revealed the reasons why we got to this point in society, which is something I had not thoroughly considered before. It sickens me how corporations were able to insidiously convince the American public that they needed to buy more. All of their different techniques (planned obsolescence, encouraging throwing away old products, doubling products, etc.) are all techniques still being used today, and I was blind to all of these frighteningly effective techniques. I remember that through middle school and the beginning of high school my parents bought me a simple flip phone that only had to capacity to make calls and text (with difficulty). I felt so out of touch seeing my classmates with their phones that they could play games on and easily text with. At the end of sophomore year, I finally got my first smartphone and it was an Android. At first, I loved it, but soon I again felt out of touch and behind my other classmates with their new iPhones. My phone struggled with group texting and I did not get some features such as AirDropping. I quickly became dissatisfied and wanted yet another new phone. For graduation, my parents bought me an iPhone 8, and I felt happy again for a while. Then I saw the new iPhone X with and its facial recognition technology, and later saw the iPhone 11 with its fancy camera and wanted more, even though I still have a perfectly functioning phone. Reading this made me realize just how effective these strategies are and that it is important to be more aware of and try to combat them. I realize now that my phone is perfectly functional, and even if it isn't in the future I can choose to refurbish it rather than throwing it away and buying a new phone. If others judge me for having an older phone then I will simply remember this reading and know that what I am doing is better for the planet.

I was not aware that consumerism had been a problem in America for so long before reading The Waste Makers by Vance Packard. I found it interesting how the author was able to conclude that there are three main techniques producers use to keep people interested in buying stuff: obsolescence of function, obsolescence of quality, and obsolescence of desirability. Thinking about each one, I determined that all of them are still prominent in today's society. However, I also think that society itself makes people want to consume more. It has become such a core part of American culture to consume, that people won't stop, even when they know how damaging it is. Apple, for example, comes out with a new iPhone every year with only a few small changes that everyone can easily live without, yet it is hyped up every year, and everyone tries to buy one just to feel validated for a small time - until the new iPhone comes out and theirs is no longer cool. Moreover, Apple also makes products which infamously break apart and need to be replaced after a few years, and if you want to prevent the damage, then you can buy additional products like phone cases or screen protectors, but even those wear out.
 <br><br>

Moreover the popularization of brands and trends through social media and pop culture add on to people's desires to buy more. Companies are aware of the influence pop culture has, so many of them have collaborated with notable celebrities in order to increase sales - like Adidas collaborating with Kanye West to produce Yeezys.
 <br><br>

Because the concept of always owning things that are "in" is so publicized, it'll be hard to get people to stop, but I think my generation can always start by slowly getting the unnecessary things out of our lives, and by popularizing the idea that not owning the newest thing in the market is perfectly fine.

I completely agree with your comment. It's crazy to think that this book was written in the 60's!! And yet, consumerism still remains a massive problem today with even more serious consequences. As I was reading this book, I also thought about Apple. Not only does Apple come out with a new phone every year with minor changes, their products most definitely have a limited life span. In my experience, it seems that as soon as my Apple Care warranty expires, so does my phone. Death-dating is a scary thought, but it's definitely still prevalent in society today. Shoes only last so long before they wear out. If they don't wear out, you're tempted to buy another pair that is more "in" right now.
 <br><br>


Obsolescence of desirability is beyond relatable to every consumer in the U.S. The best of example of this are fads that kids go through every once in awhile. When I was in 5th grade, silly bands were the most popular item on the market for kids. They were absolutely useless, but the desire to fit in drove you to buy them. Silly bands are now nowhere to be seen. Or how about fidget spinners. These were immensely popular while I was in high school, but are no longer trendy. These products would have still been sound in terms of quality, but we got rid of them due to the disappearance of the trend. Fads drive consumerism and end up contributing to a huge amount of waste. Once they are no longer cool, we dispose of them as quickly as we bought them. It's a never ending, inevitable cycle that contributes to the downfall of our climate.


<br><hr>
I had a very similar experience as you did when I read Packard’s analysis of obsolescence of function, quality, and desirability. I knew that consumerism in the United States had early roots, but that it truly began after World War II helped the United States out of the Great Depression, however, I was alarmed to realize that the companies behind consumerism have always been so aggressive in their marketing. When I read what Packard had to say about obsolescence, it felt eerily similar to marketing and production tactics we hear about now. Some examples include (like you mentioned) Apple products which are notorious for having products come out every year with very minimal changes to design, and some technological functions. Moreover, I often hear people complain about the cheap quality of things like clothing. How can we expect our clothes to be of high quality when we buy into industries that sell us items designed to wear out?
 <br><br>
I find it frightening how easily companies are able to manipulate the public into making purchase after purchase without even batting an eye. While pushing the public to spend their hard earned money on things that are usually unnecessary, companies simultaneously ruin the environment while making huge profits. Like Packard mentioned, companies will do anything to ensure that they can make a profit. He gave the examples of using patriotic slogans to make people feel like purchasing was their civic duty, and making items last long enough so that people would buy, but not be too surprised when they broke. By making things so breakable and not having a plan for what to do with the broken parts, companies only worsen our waste problems.

I hate the fact that certain products are created and become or seem useless in a short amount of time. Planned obsolescence has become the new way of life that many Americans take part in. So much stuff sold in stores like Target and Walmart are completely non-essential to living. I try my hardest to not participate in this, but it’s hard to not keep up with certain new technologies such as my iPhone. I still have the iPhone 7, but I know it’s only a matter of time before I upgrade again. I don’t want to fall behind in society. I understand planned obsolescence from an economic standpoint, but I hate that it exists. People as a whole need to consume less and recycle more. The planet is only so big and we are filling it up with garbage. Soon there will be no space for us. I’d like to have hope that consumer culture will slow down and we will change, but I fear that industrialization is irreversible.

Our consumer culture in America is undoubtedly toxic, as your value is better defined by what you own than who you are here. This toxic mentality has encouraged us to consume consume consume with the purpose of feeling respected or powerful. And sadly, it works. I see someone driving a Lamborghini and I think, "Damn, they must be really rich" or "I bet they worked really hard for that," but not, "Damn, do they really need that car" or "I bet a lot of carbon dioxide was put into the atmosphere to produce that." And while I don't think it's fair to completely reject the idea of purchasing goods or feeling accomplished, I think we can do everything we're doing right now a bit more modestly. I have begun to really ask myself the question "Do I really need this" with a lot of things, and more often than not, the answer is no.
 <br><br>
I don't think it's that much of a stretch for Americans to merely reconsider their evaluation of certain goods. Many of us don't need as much clothes as we buy, or the newest car, or a lot of the things we purchase on a day to day basis. While on an individual scale the effect of this would be practically pointless, if somehow a significant amount of Americans embraced this mindset, it would very powerful and it would be at no cost, or even positive cost, to them.

The mere idea of the way America is set up to work is astounding. We are set up in a society that’s supposed to consume without need. Everyone has everything they could ever need, so they have two of them. And it’s undeniably unhealthy and unnecessary. I’ve been slowly realizing American’s sick addiction over the past few weeks thanks to this class, but I hadn’t heard the other side at all yet. Why do producers continue to produce when they know that there’s nothing left that people need? Yes, obviously it’s their income, but they’ve either intentionally or not created a never ending cycle, and they’re going to have to keep up with it as well. Apple, for example. Almost everyone I know owns an iPhone; and not just an iPhone, the new iPhone. Someone pulls out an old model, and it’s instantly everyone around them heckling them for not having the new model yet. How could you have had that for so long? Well, it’s really not that long. The technology we have now is so advanced that it should be able to last ages without fail, yet we all go out to buy the new ones when they come out. And why? Because it’s literally in our nature. “The Waste Makers” was an interesting look at what goes through the minds of producers when coming up with new ideas to sell new products that people don’t need. The point of buying something used to be a necessity, but now it’s far from that. Gadgets are what my dad calls them. Fancy new gadgets that aren’t needed but simply wanted, and maybe with no reason even behind the want. I had no idea that the buying surge started after the war, but it makes sense. People replenished what they then needed, and then the thrill of shopping was too strong so people kept at it, and the producers kept producing new gadgets. It’s an endless cycle that we need to step out of and break, or else our environment is going to be tremendously harmed, as well as the image America has put out to the rest of the world for a long time now.
